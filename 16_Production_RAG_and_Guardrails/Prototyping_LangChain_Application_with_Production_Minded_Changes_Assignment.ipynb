    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Wait for processing  \n",

    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",

    "##### ❓ Question #1: Production Caching Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
    "- **Cache size management**\n",
    "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: There is no single correct answer here! Discuss the trade-offs with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**: \n",
    "    - Memory caching means, its emphemeral as soon as the application shutsdown, it is lost, a loss of all the build up time and effort\n",
    "    - Disk caching means we can continue from where we left, and it can also be transfered to or shared between other apps within reasons\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** : Cache invalidation strategies are an age old challenge not many, if any, have been able to resolve. And the trade-offs here are between speed and accuracy, either we gain speed by not invalidating often, and loose out on accuracy (as the underlying data might have changed). Or we invalidate too often, and loose out on the advantages of lazy evaluation and may gain some accuracy in the process. The common one beign TTL (time-based expiration) and also invalidating based on change in version (Version based invalidation)\n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**: another challenge between accuracy & availability, and speed. In addition there's issues like race-condition like any other concurrent system, lock retention and cache coherence issues due to these related issues\n",
    "- **Cache size management**: Cache sizes can go crazy big depending on what we are caching and for how long (similar challenge to the \"Cache invalidation strategies\"), when to cap the size and when to drop the old storage for the new? Many systems since early on have also been able to help track the most often used/invoked pathway, and hence we keep those and sacrifice the least often used one\n",
    "- **Cold start scenarios**: means building up the cache from scratch before the application is warm enough to efficiently handle all requests coming in its direction. Which also means different cache warming strategies would need to be tested to see which one works best for the application. Or should we build the cache while the application is starting up (progressive building).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we haven't covered from the above is, cache encryption and cache retention for data security and regulatory purposes."

      "🔄 Simple Agent Response:\n",
      "Common student loan repayment timelines in California typically include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Standard Repayment Plan: New borrowers are automatically placed on this plan, which offers fixed monthly payments for a period of 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grace Period: After graduating, falling below half-time student status, withdrawing, or not attending for a quarter, there is usually a grace period before repayment begins. For Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and California Dream Loans, this grace period is six months. For University Loans, it is nine months.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plans: These plans adjust payments based on income and family size, making payments more affordable. Forgiveness of any remaining balance may occur after 20-25 years of payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Forgives the remaining balance after 120 qualifying payments (typically 10 years) while working full-time for a government or nonprofit employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Repayment Resumption: Student loan payments fully resumed on October 1, 2024, following the COVID-19 federal student loan payment pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are specific California programs offering loan repayment assistance or forgiveness for certain professions, such as healthcare providers working in shortage areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need more detailed information about specific loan types or repayment options, please let me know!\n",

    "\n",
    "Compare the Simple Agent vs Helpfulness Agent architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
    "   - Simple Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
    "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
    "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?\n",
    "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?\n",
    "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability Questions:**\n",
    "   - How would these agents perform under high concurrent load?\n",
    "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
    "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Discuss these trade-offs with your group!\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "1. The helpfulness agent in this implementation is a simple one as compared to how we would implement it in production, but definitely the advantages between them are:\n",
    "- Simple agent: \n",
    "   - less overhead, runtime and development time\n",
    "   - less reliable in terms of the responses are not checked or evaluated\n",
    "   - leading to no data on how it could be improved, would need to collect data and analyse responses separately, and these would be offline improvements only (retro-fit into the application, and re-deploy and re-run it)\n",
    "   - from the above we can say - risk of poor responses and no quality check validations\n",
    "- Helpfulness agent: \n",
    "   - a more overhead, runtime and development time and also production cost leading to additional API costs\n",
    "   - more reliable in terms of the responses are checked or evaluated, hence data to make future improvements can be collected to perform such offline or online improvements (while the application is running)\n",
    "   - from the above we can say - quality assurance via self-evaluation\n",
    "   - encourages iterative improvements using the data collected\n",
    "2. A portion of the time is taken into checking for the response this adds to the small gestation period before attention is returned to the caller. This is subjective to the real application logic followed in production. In the case of the current Helpfulness agent, additional latency cost (50% and above), cost in money (2 to 3x API calls as compared to the Simple Agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative refinement is an investment (but a more efficient and pragmatic process) to creating a better product and striking a balance between doing everything in one sitting compared to slicing it into smaller layers/slices and implementing them gradually and applying feedback to it. It also uses data from previous instances to build improvements in the next steps/instances of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent performance, is a broad topic, firstly we need to draft out what do we mean by performance, do we mean its responsiveness, or the correctness/accuracy in the responses or its reliability and robustness/agility when managing a large number of requests. We could capture and track the evaluation scores/metrics, success rate, refinement frequency, user feedback (human-in-the-loop) and also runtime metrics like response time, failure rate, etc..., and visualise them in a real-time dashboard adding alerts at threshold points for each of the metrics. Tools like LangSmith and W&B are very good at capturing such metrics and producing them in dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under heavy load simple agent would perform better than the helpfulness agent which would need mananging the evaluation aspects of that pipeline/system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching would help both the agents by caching the final results and evaluation results respectively for simple and helpfulness agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the helpfulness agents escalation in the number of failures in response or timeouts should result in circuit-breakers, which should fall-back to using the simple agents until the helpfulness agent is back up again."

    "##### 🏗️ Activity #3: Building a Production-Safe LangGraph Agent with Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
