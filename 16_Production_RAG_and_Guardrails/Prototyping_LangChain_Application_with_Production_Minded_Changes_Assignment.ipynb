    "##### ❓ Question #1: Production Caching Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
    "- **Cache size management**\n",
    "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: There is no single correct answer here! Discuss the trade-offs with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**: \n",
    "    - Memory caching means, its emphemeral as soon as the application shutsdown, it is lost, a loss of all the build up time and effort\n",
    "    - Disk caching means we can continue from where we left, and it can also be transfered to or shared between other apps within reasons\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** : Cache invalidation strategies are an age old challenge not many, if any, have been able to resolve. And the trade-offs here are between speed and accuracy, either we gain speed by not invalidating often, and loose out on accuracy (as the underlying data might have changed). Or we invalidate too often, and loose out on the advantages of lazy evaluation and may gain some accuracy in the process. The common one beign TTL (time-based expiration) and also invalidating based on change in version (Version based invalidation)\n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**: another challenge between accuracy & availability, and speed. In addition there's issues like race-condition like any other concurrent system, lock retention and cache coherence issues due to these related issues\n",

      "Repayment timelines can vary depending on the type of loan or debt. Here are some common scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For student loans in California, a qualifying repayment plan could be an income-driven repayment plan or the standard 10-year repayment plan. Payments are typically due no later than 15 days after the due date. Monthly bills, with the payment amount and due date, are usually sent at least 21 days before the due date ([source](https://dfpi.ca.gov/consumers/student-loans/options/)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For credit card debt, the time to pay off the debt can vary based on the amount and the monthly payment. For example, if you're paying $500 a month, it would take 12 months to pay off a $5,000 debt, 26 months for a $10,000 debt, and 72 months for a $20,000 debt. These estimates are based on an average credit card interest rate of 21.56% ([source](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/credit-cards/debt-repayment)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For Medicare overpayments, any approved repayment schedule would run from the approval date. If the provider doesn't respond, interim payments will be withheld starting on the 16th day from the date of the notice, and applied towards the outstanding overpayment balance ([source](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/fin106c04pdf.pdf)).\n",

    "Compare the Simple Agent vs Helpfulness Agent architectures:\n",

    "   - Simple Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
    "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",

    "   - How would these agents perform under high concurrent load?\n",
    "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
    "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Discuss these trade-offs with your group!\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "1. The helpfulness agent in this implementation is a simple one as compared to how we would implement it in production, but definitely the advantages between them are:\n",
    "- Simple agent: \n",
    "   - less overhead, runtime and development time\n",
    "   - less reliable in terms of the responses are not checked or evaluated\n",
    "   - leading to no data on how it could be improved, would need to collect data and analyse responses separately, and these would be offline improvements only (retro-fit into the application, and re-deploy and re-run it)\n",
    "   - from the above we can say - risk of poor responses and no quality check validations\n",
    "- Helpfulness agent: \n",
    "   - a more overhead, runtime and development time and also production cost leading to additional API costs\n",
    "   - more reliable in terms of the responses are checked or evaluated, hence data to make future improvements can be collected to perform such offline or online improvements (while the application is running)\n",
    "   - from the above we can say - quality assurance via self-evaluation\n",
    "   - encourages iterative improvements using the data collected\n",
    "2. A portion of the time is taken into checking for the response this adds to the small gestation period before attention is returned to the caller. This is subjective to the real application logic followed in production. In the case of the current Helpfulness agent, additional latency cost (50% and above), cost in money (2 to 3x API calls as compared to the Simple Agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative refinement is an investment (but a more efficient and pragmatic process) to creating a better product and striking a balance between doing everything in one sitting compared to slicing it into smaller layers/slices and implementing them gradually and applying feedback to it. It also uses data from previous instances to build improvements in the next steps/instances of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent performance, is a broad topic, firstly we need to draft out what do we mean by performance, do we mean its responsiveness, or the correctness/accuracy in the responses or its reliability and robustness/agility when managing a large number of requests. We could capture and track the evaluation scores/metrics, success rate, refinement frequency, user feedback (human-in-the-loop) and also runtime metrics like response time, failure rate, etc..., and visualise them in a real-time dashboard adding alerts at threshold points for each of the metrics. Tools like LangSmith and W&B are very good at capturing such metrics and producing them in dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under heavy load simple agent would perform better than the helpfulness agent which would need mananging the evaluation aspects of that pipeline/system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching would help both the agents by caching the final results and evaluation results respectively for simple and helpfulness agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the helpfulness agents escalation in the number of failures in response or timeouts should result in circuit-breakers, which should fall-back to using the simple agents until the helpfulness agent is back up again."

    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
