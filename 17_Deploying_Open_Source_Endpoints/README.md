**‚ö†Ô∏è!!! PLEASE BE SURE TO SHUTDOWN YOUR DEDICATED ENDPOINT ON TOGETHER AI WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED YOUR ASSIGNMENT !!!‚ö†Ô∏è**

In today's assignment, we'll be creating Together AI endpoints, and then building an Agentic RAG application.

- ü§ù Breakout Room #1
    - Set-up Open Source Endpoint (Instructions [here](./ENDPOINT_SETUP.md))
    - Test Endpoint and Embeddings with the `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` notebook.

- ü§ù Breakout Room #2
    - Use the Open Source Endpoints to build an Agentic RAG LangGraph application (use Session 14/15 code to get started)

> NOTE: You should look toward: [ChatTogether](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/together/), and [TogetherEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/together/) for help on how to build these endpoints into your application!

> NOTE: You will have to add libraries to your `pyproject.toml` with `uv add`. You could also bring in a previous environment.

## Ship üö¢

The completed notebook/app!

<details>
<summary>üöß Advanced Build üöß (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

Use RAGAS to evaluate your open-source powered app against an OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini` powered Agentic RAG app.
</details>

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the two notebooks for the main homework assignment; or
  - the notebook you created for the Bonus Challenge

## Share üöÄ

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:

## Submitting You Homework [OPTIONAL]

### Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE7` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s17-assignment`
2. Follow the instructions in `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md` 
> _**NOTE: Make sure you select an Auto-shutdown!**_
3. Respond to the question at the end of the `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md`
    + Create a header (example: `##### ‚úÖ Answer:`) to help the grader find your responses
    + Enter your answer below the header
4. Replace both `model` values in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` with the `gpt-oss` endpoint you created in Step 2 
5. Run the code cells in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb`
6. Commit, and push your changes to your `origin` repository. _NOTE: Do not merge them into your main branch_
7. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session
8. Make sure to include all of the following on your Homework Submission Form:
    + The GitHub URL to the `17_Deploying_Open_Source_Endpoints` folder _on your assignment branch (not main)_
    + The URL to your Loom Video
    + Your Three lessons learned/not yet learned
    + The URLs to any social media posts (LinkedIn, X, Discord, etc.) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è _easy Extra Credit points!_
