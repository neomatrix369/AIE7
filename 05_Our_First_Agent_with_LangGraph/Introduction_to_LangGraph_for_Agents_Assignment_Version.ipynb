        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/rambodazimi/KD-LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale. Without introducing new experiments, we aim to improve the\\nunderstanding and application of LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-18\\nTitle: LoRA-drop: Efficient LoRA Parameter Pruning based on Output Evaluation\\nAuthors: Hongyun Zhou, Xiangyu Lu, Wang Xu, Conghui Zhu, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun Yang\\nSummary: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is currently the most commonly used\\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, it introduces auxiliary\\nparameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited\\ncomputing resources. However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\", name='arxiv', id='ad1e94a1-8df0-4c9e-b3c0-847368f31b5f', tool_call_id='call_S5G2AZ7d5P4QtyVOXhZgukAQ'), ToolMessage(content='[{\"title\": \"Interviewing Tim Dettmers on open-source AI - Interconnects\", \"url\": \"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/tim-dettmers\", \"content\": \"Tim Dettmers does not need an introduction for most people building open-source AI.

This survey\\nprovides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the\\nliterature. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a\\nframework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various\\nmeasures for evaluating attention models are reviewed, and methods to\\ncharacterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework\\nare discussed. Last, future work in the field of attention models is\\nconsidered.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-07-04\\nTitle: Attention mechanisms for physiological signal deep learning: which attention should we take?\\nAuthors: Seong-A Park, Hyung-Chul Lee, Chul-Woo Jung, Hyun-Lim Yang\\nSummary: Attention mechanisms are widely used to dramatically improve deep learning\\nmodel performance in various fields. However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='1704d0ce-f67d-4e61-812a-ef119beae90b', tool_call_id='call_Pbd1crDnejnWhUG4tQApbKs4')]\n",
