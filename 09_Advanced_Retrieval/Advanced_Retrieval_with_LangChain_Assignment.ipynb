For example, some borrowers did not receive notifications about when repayments were to begin or when their loans were transferred to different servicers, leading to unexpected delinquencies and credit issues.\\n\\n2. **Compounding and Growing Interest:** Borrowers reported that interest continued to accrue even during forbearance or deferment periods, which made it difficult or impossible to pay down the actual loan amount. This effectively extended the repayment period and increased total debt, causing frustration and financial hardship.\\n\\n3. **Inadequate or Restrictive Payment Options:** Several complaints pointed out that the available options, such as forbearance or deferment, either did not reduce the loan balance or led to accumulating interest that negated payments made. Additionally, some borrowers felt they could not afford increased monthly payments necessary to clear their debt faster.\\n\\n4. **Servicing Issues and Mismanagement:** Some borrowers experienced issues with their loan servicers, such as being placed into long-term forbearance repeatedly, being unable to apply extra payments toward the principal, or facing difficulties in setting up or modifying payment plans. These practices contributed to their inability to reduce or pay off their loans.\\n\\n5. **Unforeseen and Unexplained Delinquencies:** Lack of proper notifications or failure to notify borrowers about overdue payments led to missed payments and adverse effects on credit scores. Some borrowers also faced incorrect reporting of delinquencies without proper explanation or notification.\\n\\n6. **Economic Hardship and Unexpected Life Events:** Many borrowers faced financial hardships such as unemployment, stagnant wages, or unexpected expenses, making it difficult to keep up with payments. In some cases, they did not qualify for loan forgiveness programs or were unaware of alternative repayment options.\\n\\nIn summary, the failures in communication, loan management, and the structure of repayment options, combined with economic hardships and interest accumulation, contributed to many individuals being unable to pay back their loans.'"

    "## Task 8: Parent Document Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
    "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
    "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
    "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, maybe that was a few steps - but the basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for small documents\n",
    "- Return big documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that we're likely to find the most relevant information by limiting the amount of semantic information that is encoded in each embedding vector - but we're likely to miss relevant surrounding context if we only use that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating our \"parent documents\" and defining a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`."
