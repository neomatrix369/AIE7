    "#### ❓ Question #1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Give an example query where BM25 is better than embeddings and justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25, a traditional full-text search ranking function, is particularly effective when dealing with queries that rely heavily on exact term matching, term frequency, and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 is generally better suited for scenarios where exact keyword matching is essential, such as in e-commerce search engines, document retrieval systems, and legal e-discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, BM25 is often used in hybrid search systems alongside vector search to create a more comprehensive understanding of both semantic meaning and keyword importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of queries where the exact matching terms in the document would be essential to prevent a lot of results with noise and near close terms but not close enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Find documents about COVID-19 vaccine side effects in patients with diabetes\"\n",
    "  - the key terms here COVID-19 vaccine and diabetes are were the focus is in the query\n",
    "- \"Best practices for data backup in 2025\"\n",
    "  - It includes specific terms like \"data backup\" and \"2025\" that are likely to appear verbatim in relevant documents.\n",
    "  - BM25 can effectively leverage term frequency (e.g., how often \"data backup\" appears in a document) and document length normalization to rank documents accurately. The query does not heavily rely on semantic similarity but rather on the presence and frequency of exact keywords.\n",
    "  - In contrast, dense embeddings might struggle if the training data does not include similar phrasing or if the semantic model does not strongly associate \"best practices\" with \"data backup\" in the context of 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings, on the other hand, are better suited for capturing semantic relationships between words and documents. If embeddings were used in the above scenarios or use-cases, the precision of the results would not be as accurate as with BM25.\n"

    "### Addendum\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Sparse Embeddings** are high-dimensional vectors where most values are zero, with only a few non-zero values representing specific features or tokens that are present, making them memory-efficient and interpretable but limited to explicit feature representation._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Dense Embeddings** are vectors where most or all dimensions have non-zero values, creating rich, continuous representations that capture complex semantic relationships and contextual meaning, but require more storage and are less interpretable._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Key Difference:** Sparse embeddings work like \"on/off switches\" for specific features (like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF), while dense embeddings work like \"semantic fingerprints\" where every dimension contributes to the overall meaning representation - sparse focuses on explicit presence/absence, dense captures nuanced relationships._\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Sparse Retrieval** uses exact keyword matching with algorithms like BM25, where documents are represented as sparse vectors containing only the specific terms that appear in them, making it excellent for precise term-based searches but limited to lexical matches._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Dense Retrieval** uses semantic embeddings where documents and queries are converted into dense vector representations that capture meaning and context, allowing it to find semantically similar content even when different words are used, but potentially missing exact keyword matches._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Key Difference:** Sparse retrieval excels at \"what you search is what you get\" with exact terms, while dense retrieval excels at \"what you mean is what you get\" through semantic understanding - which is why hybrid approaches combining both often work best._\n"

During these periods, interest continued to grow, making the total amount owed larger over time and creating a cycle where payments could be insufficient to offset the interest, prolonging repayment.\\n\\n3. Financial Hardships: Many borrowers experienced difficulties in making payments due to stagnant wages, inflation, and unmanageable debt levels. Some could not increase payments to reduce the principal without sacrificing basic necessities, and others found that their repayments did not significantly decrease the total debt due to interest accumulation.\\n\\n4. Limited Payment Options: The available options, such as forbearance or deferment, often led to increased overall debt because interest continued to accrue during these periods, extending the repayment timeline and increasing total costs.\\n\\n5. Misleading or Unclear Information: Borrowers sometimes felt misled about their repayment obligations and the true cost of their loans.

Instead, they were steered into long-term forbearance or consolidation, which increased their debt burdens.\\n\\n3. **Poor communication and misrepresentation by servicers:** Several complaints highlight that servicers failed to give proper notice of delinquency, provided incorrect or confusing information about loan balances and statuses, or did not follow federal regulations regarding notification and collection efforts.\\n\\n4. **High interest rates and mismanagement:** For some borrowers, their loan balances grew significantly due to high interest rates, misapplied payments, or unauthorized transfers between servicers, making repayment impossible.\\n\\n5. **Financial hardships and unexpected circumstances:** Borrowers faced hardships such as unemployment, health issues, homelessness, or economic challenges, which made them unable to afford payments, especially when combined with the increasing balances due to interest.\\n\\n6. **Systemic flaws and predatory practices:** Several complaints describe practices like \"forbearance steering\" or coercive consolidation that worsened borrowers\\' situations, along with systemic failures in loan reporting, record-keeping, and handling of disputes.\\n\\nIn summary, many borrowers failed to pay back their loans because the system often prioritized collecting interest and fees over providing manageable repayment solutions, leading to unmanageable debt, confusion, and lack of support during financial hardships.'"

    "#### ❓ Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how generating multiple reformulations of a user query can improve recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple reformulations improve recall because relevant documents may use different terminology than the original query, and each reformulation can surface documents the others miss (different phrasings in multiple reformulations of a query can match different relevant documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, multiple reformulations approach the same query from different angles/facets, leading to retrieval of documents covering those various angles. This increases the confluence of documents around the common theme while capturing variations in terminology and perspective, thereby enhancing retrieval scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since such retrievers that use multiple reformulations would follow the below steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Generates multiple query variations from the original query using an LLM\n",
    "  2. Retrieves documents for each variation (each gets k results)\n",
    "  3. Deduplicates and merges the results from all queries\n",
    "  4. Returns the final deduplicated set\n",
    "\n",
    "The return results from multiple reformulations would be more beneficial as a retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example would be \"machine learning algorithms\" vs \"AI models\" retrieves different relevant documents but around the same or similar theme."

    "## Task 8: Parent Document Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
    "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
    "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
    "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, maybe that was a few steps - but the basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for small documents\n",
    "- Return big documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that we're likely to find the most relevant information by limiting the amount of semantic information that is encoded in each embedding vector - but we're likely to miss relevant surrounding context if we only use that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating our \"parent documents\" and defining a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`."

    "1. Embedding all sentences in the corpus.\n",
    "2. Combining or splitting sequences of sentences based on their semantic similarity based on a number of [possible thresholding methods](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/semantic-chunker/):\n",

    "  - `standard_deviation`\n",

    "\n",
    "1. _\"percentile\" (default)_\n",
    "- Splits when sentence embedding distance exceeds the 95th percentile of all distances\n",
    "- Effect: Creates chunks at the most semantically distinct boundaries\n",
    "- Behavior: More conservative splitting, larger chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _\"standard_deviation\"_\n",
    "- Splits when distance exceeds 3 standard deviations from mean\n",

    "#### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Short and highly repetitive sentences create _minimal embedding distance_ variations, making it difficult to detect _meaningful semantic_ boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold Type Behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"percentile\" (95th percentile)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Creates very few chunks since most distances are similar\n",
    "- Issue: May group unrelated FAQ topics together\n",
    "- Adjustment: Lower to 75-85th percentile to increase sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"standard_deviation\" (3σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Performs poorly due to low variance in short, similar sentences\n",
    "- Issue: Creates massive chunks with no meaningful breaks\n",
    "- Adjustment: Reduce to 1-2 standard deviations for more splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"interquartile\" (IQR × 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Most robust for FAQs due to outlier resistance\n",
    "- Issue: Still may miss subtle topic transitions\n",
    "- Adjustment: Reduce scaling factor to 0.8-1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"gradient\" (anomaly detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Best performer - detects subtle topic shifts in repetitive content\n",
    "- Issue: May be overly sensitive to minor variations\n",
    "- Adjustment: Fine-tune threshold to 85-90th percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Use \"gradient\" with _85th percentile_ + minimum chunk size constraints + keyword-based post-processing to ensure FAQ topics remain grouped appropriately despite repetitive language patterns."
