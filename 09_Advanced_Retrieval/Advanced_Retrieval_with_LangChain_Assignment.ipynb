Lowering monthly payments often resulted in interest compounding, making it difficult to pay down the principal.\\n\\n2. **Financial hardships and income challenges:** Borrowers faced economic difficulties such as stagnant wages, high living expenses, unemployment, or underemployment, which made it impossible to afford higher payments or even maintain existing payments.\\n\\n3. **Lack of clear communication and transparency:** Many borrowers were not adequately informed about their loan status, payment resumption dates, or changes in loan servicers. Sudden reporting of delinquency or late payments without proper notification led to credit score drops and financial setbacks.\\n\\n4. **Issues with loan management and servicing practices:** Some borrowers reported being placed on long-term forbearance, experiencing unresponsive or unhelpful customer service, or facing difficulties applying extra funds toward principal or paying off smaller loans faster.\\n\\n5. **Complicated and unfavorable repayment terms:** Borrowers often found repayment options limited or unaffordable and felt misled about the total amount owed, the impact of interest, or the availability of forgiveness programs.\\n\\n6. **Loan mismanagement and errors:** In some cases, there were errors such as incorrect reporting of delinquencies, improper transfer of loans between servicers without notification, or failure to notify borrowers when repayment was due, all of which contributed to missed payments.\\n\\nOverall, a combination of economic hardship, complex loan servicing practices, and poor communication contributed to many borrowers' inability to successfully repay their loans.\""

    "#### ❓ Question #1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Give an example query where BM25 is better than embeddings and justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25, a traditional full-text search ranking function, is particularly effective when dealing with queries that rely heavily on exact term matching, term frequency, and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 is generally better suited for scenarios where exact keyword matching is essential, such as in e-commerce search engines, document retrieval systems, and legal e-discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, BM25 is often used in hybrid search systems alongside vector search to create a more comprehensive understanding of both semantic meaning and keyword importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of queries where the exact matching terms in the document would be essential to prevent a lot of results with noise and near close terms but not close enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Find documents about COVID-19 vaccine side effects in patients with diabetes\"\n",
    "  - the key terms here COVID-19 vaccine and diabetes are were the focus is in the query\n",
    "- \"Best practices for data backup in 2025\"\n",
    "  - It includes specific terms like \"data backup\" and \"2025\" that are likely to appear verbatim in relevant documents.\n",
    "  - BM25 can effectively leverage term frequency (e.g., how often \"data backup\" appears in a document) and document length normalization to rank documents accurately. The query does not heavily rely on semantic similarity but rather on the presence and frequency of exact keywords.\n",
    "  - In contrast, dense embeddings might struggle if the training data does not include similar phrasing or if the semantic model does not strongly associate \"best practices\" with \"data backup\" in the context of 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings, on the other hand, are better suited for capturing semantic relationships between words and documents. If embeddings were used in the above scenarios or use-cases, the precision of the results would not be as accurate as with BM25.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Addendum\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Sparse Embeddings** are high-dimensional vectors where most values are zero, with only a few non-zero values representing specific features or tokens that are present, making them memory-efficient and interpretable but limited to explicit feature representation._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Dense Embeddings** are vectors where most or all dimensions have non-zero values, creating rich, continuous representations that capture complex semantic relationships and contextual meaning, but require more storage and are less interpretable._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Key Difference:** Sparse embeddings work like \"on/off switches\" for specific features (like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF), while dense embeddings work like \"semantic fingerprints\" where every dimension contributes to the overall meaning representation - sparse focuses on explicit presence/absence, dense captures nuanced relationships._\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Sparse Retrieval** uses exact keyword matching with algorithms like BM25, where documents are represented as sparse vectors containing only the specific terms that appear in them, making it excellent for precise term-based searches but limited to lexical matches._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Dense Retrieval** uses semantic embeddings where documents and queries are converted into dense vector representations that capture meaning and context, allowing it to find semantically similar content even when different words are used, but potentially missing exact keyword matches._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Key Difference:** Sparse retrieval excels at \"what you search is what you get\" with exact terms, while dense retrieval excels at \"what you mean is what you get\" through semantic understanding - which is why hybrid approaches combining both often work best._\n"

For example, some borrowers' accounts were reported as delinquent or in default despite being current, often due to reporting errors or lack of proper notices.\\n\\n2. **Lack of Proper Communication and Notification:** Several accounts of borrowers not being informed about the resumption of payments, changes in servicers, or delinquency status. For instance, borrowers reported receiving no prior notices before being marked as late or delinquent, which hindered their ability to manage payments.\\n\\n3. **Inadequate Guidance and Support:** Complaints include instances where servicers failed to inform borrowers about available repayment options such as income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation, leading borrowers into long-term forbearances. These long forbearances often resulted in increased interest and ballooned balances.\\n\\n4. **Aggressive and Coercive Practices:** Reports of forbearance steering, where borrowers were pressured into forbearances or consolidations without proper disclosure of alternatives, ultimately increasing their debt burden and interest capitalization. Some borrowers were coerced into consolidations under false pretenses, causing balances to increase significantly.\\n\\n5. **Errors and Fraudulent Activities:** There are complaints about accounts being accessed without permission, inaccurate reporting, and even potential FERPA violations, which can lead to confusion and default misreporting.\\n\\n6. **Financial Hardship and Lack of Alternatives:** Many borrowers faced financial hardship, unemployment, or medical issues, which made repayment difficult, especially when servicers failed to offer or inform borrowers about alternative programs like income-driven plans, loan forgiveness, or discharge options.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to repay loans often stemmed from systemic mismanagement, lack of transparency, poor communication, coercive practices by servicers, and mishandling of accounts, all of which impeded borrowers’ ability to manage their loans effectively.\""

    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple reformulations improve recall because relevant documents may use different terminology than the original query, and each reformulation can surface documents the others miss (different phrasings in multiple reformulations of a query can match different relevant documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, multiple reformulations approach the same query from different angles/facets, leading to retrieval of documents covering those various angles. This increases the confluence of documents around the common theme while capturing variations in terminology and perspective, thereby enhancing retrieval scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since such retrievers that use multiple reformulations would follow the below steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Generates multiple query variations from the original query using an LLM\n",
    "  2. Retrieves documents for each variation (each gets k results)\n",
    "  3. Deduplicates and merges the results from all queries\n",
    "  4. Returns the final deduplicated set\n",
    "\n",
    "The return results from multiple reformulations would be more beneficial as a retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example would be \"machine learning algorithms\" vs \"AI models\" retrieves different relevant documents but around the same or similar theme."

    "\n",
    "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
    "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
    "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
    "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, maybe that was a few steps - but the basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for small documents\n",
    "- Return big documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that we're likely to find the most relevant information by limiting the amount of semantic information that is encoded in each embedding vector - but we're likely to miss relevant surrounding context if we only use that information.\n",

       "\"People failed to pay back their loans primarily due to a combination of factors highlighted in the complaints:\\n\\n1. **Lack of clear communication and notification:** Many borrowers were not adequately informed about their repayment status, whether their loans had resumed, or when payments were due. Several complaints mention not receiving proper notices, emails, or mail, leading to unexpected delinquencies and credit impacts.\\n\\n2. **Mismanagement and errors by loan servicers:** Servicers, such as Nelnet, Maximus, EdFinancial, and others, have been reported to mishandle accounts—incorrectly reporting delinquencies, refusing to provide accurate information, or failing to follow regulations. This mismanagement often results in increased balances, erroneous defaults, or inaccurate credit reporting.\\n\\n3. **Interest accumulation and forbearance practices:** Borrowers were often steered into forbearance or deferment without adequate understanding of how interest would accrue or options to minimize long-term costs. Long-term forbearance can cause interest to compound, increasing debt beyond the original loan amount.\\n\\n4. **Inability to access or understand repayment options:** Many complainants did not receive information about income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness programs, or the consequences of forbearance and consolidation. Without this guidance, borrowers could inadvertently fall into default or see their balances grow due to accumulated interest.\\n\\n5. **Payment processing issues:** Some borrowers experienced payments being reversed or not correctly applied, leading to delinquencies and negative credit impacts, despite making timely payments.\\n\\n6. **Loan transfers and improper handling:** Multiple complaints mention loans being transferred or sold without proper notification, causing confusion and errors in account management.\\n\\n7. **Economic hardship and personal circumstances:** A subset of borrowers faced financial hardship, unemployment, or health issues, making repayment unsustainable, especially when combined with high interest, miscommunication, and lack of supportive options.\\n\\nOverall, failure to repay was often not due to irresponsibility but rather systemic mismanagement, lack of transparent communication, and practices that hindered borrowers' ability to manage or understand their loans effectively.\""

    "#### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Short and highly repetitive sentences create _minimal embedding distance_ variations, making it difficult to detect _meaningful semantic_ boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold Type Behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"percentile\" (95th percentile)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Creates very few chunks since most distances are similar\n",
    "- Issue: May group unrelated FAQ topics together\n",
    "- Adjustment: Lower to 75-85th percentile to increase sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"standard_deviation\" (3σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Performs poorly due to low variance in short, similar sentences\n",
    "- Issue: Creates massive chunks with no meaningful breaks\n",
    "- Adjustment: Reduce to 1-2 standard deviations for more splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"interquartile\" (IQR × 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Most robust for FAQs due to outlier resistance\n",
    "- Issue: Still may miss subtle topic transitions\n",
    "- Adjustment: Reduce scaling factor to 0.8-1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"gradient\" (anomaly detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Best performer - detects subtle topic shifts in repetitive content\n",
    "- Issue: May be overly sensitive to minor variations\n",
    "- Adjustment: Fine-tune threshold to 85-90th percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Use \"gradient\" with _85th percentile_ + minimum chunk size constraints + keyword-based post-processing to ensure FAQ topics remain grouped appropriately despite repetitive language patterns."
