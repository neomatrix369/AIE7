What are academic years in the context of educational programs?,"['Chapter 1 Academic Years, Academic Calendars, Payment Periods, and Disbursements Academic Year Requirements Every eligible program must have a defined academic year. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the school9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter). A school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and define different academic years for each version. If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which program the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes. Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum number of weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time. Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which do not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later. Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want to request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing of contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center. For all Title IV programs, a week of instructional time is any period of seven consecutive days in which 3 At least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the last scheduled day of classes']","Academic years are defined periods that every eligible program must have, which can vary for different programs within a school. They are based on weeks of instructional time, with at least 30 weeks for credit-hour programs and 26 weeks for clock-hour programs. The academic year does not have to match the school's academic calendar and can differ for various program types or versions, such as day and night programs. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is determined by instructional weeks, and schools must demonstrate which program a student is enrolled in if they take courses from multiple versions.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
