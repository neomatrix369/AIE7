What is the role of the School Participation Division in relation to academic year requirements?,"['Chapter 1 Academic Years, Academic Calendars, Payment Periods, and Disbursements Academic Year Requirements Every eligible program must have a defined academic year. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the school9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter). A school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and define different academic years for each version. If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which program the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes. Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum number of weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time. Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which do not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later. Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want to request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing of contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center.

"In the context of Chapter 3, how does the inclusion of clinical work conducted outside the classroom affect the classification of standard and nonstandard terms in medical and education programs, and what are the specific criteria that determine whether such clinical work allows a term to be considered standard?","['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Inclusion of clinical work in a standard term depends on several criteria: all students must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a requirement for licensure or practice; the school has little or no control over the timing of the clinical work, which may be due to external licensing bodies or scheduling needs; and the credit hours for the clinical work must be associated with the term during which most of the training occurs, even if the dates overlap or do not align exactly. If these conditions are met, terms including such clinical work are not considered nonstandard, even if they overlap with other terms. This flexibility applies specifically to clinical work in programs like medicine, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching for teaching certificates. Conversely, nonstandard terms are those that do not conform to typical lengths, such as less than nine weeks or more than 21 weeks, or if academic progress is measured differently from standard practices. Therefore, clinical work meeting all the specified criteria can allow a term to be classified as standard despite overlaps or irregularities.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which program the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes. Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum number of weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time. Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which do not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later. Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want to request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing of contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center. For all Title IV programs, a week of instructional time is any period of seven consecutive days in which 3 At least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the last scheduled day of classes', '<2-hop>\n\nChapter 1 Academic Years, Academic Calendars, Payment Periods, and Disbursements Academic Year Requirements Every eligible program must have a defined academic year. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the school9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter).

For example, a school may define separate academic years for credit-hour and clock-hour programs, which must include at least 30 and 26 weeks of instructional time respectively. These definitions ensure compliance with federal requirements, even if the academic years do not coincide with the overall school calendar. Additionally, schools can request approval to establish shorter academic years, as long as they meet the minimum instructional weeks, to maintain program eligibility and proper disbursement of federal aid.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does Volume 8 address inclusion of clinical work in standard terms for programs with nonstandard terms?,"['<1-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience.
