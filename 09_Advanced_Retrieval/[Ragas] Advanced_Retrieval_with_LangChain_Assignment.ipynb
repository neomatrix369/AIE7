    "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",

    "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially, Semantic Chunking is implemented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding all sentences in the corpus.\n",
    "2. Combining or splitting sequences of sentences based on their semantic similarity based on a number of [possible thresholding methods](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/semantic-chunker/):\n",
    "  - `percentile`\n",
    "  - `standard_deviation`\n",
    "  - `interquartile`\n",
    "  - `gradient`\n",
    "3. Each sequence of related sentences is kept as a document!\n",

    "The `breakpoint_threshold_type` parameter controls when the semantic chunker creates chunk boundaries based on embedding similarity between sentences:\n",

    "**Four Threshold Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _\"percentile\" (default)_\n",
    "- Splits when sentence embedding distance exceeds the 95th percentile of all distances\n",
    "- Effect: Creates chunks at the most semantically distinct boundaries\n",
    "- Behavior: More conservative splitting, larger chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _\"standard_deviation\"_\n",
    "- Splits when distance exceeds 3 standard deviations from mean\n",
    "- Effect: Better predictable performance, especially for normally distributed content\n",
    "- Behavior: More consistent chunk sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _\"interquartile\"_\n",
    "- Uses IQR * 1.5 scaling factor to determine breakpoints\n",
    "- Effect: Middle-ground approach, robust to outliers\n",
    "- Behavior: Balanced chunk distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "4. _\"gradient\"_\n",
    "- Detects anomalies in embedding distance gradients\n",
    "- Effect: Best for domain-specific/highly correlated content\n",
    "- Behavior: Finds subtle semantic transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** _The threshold type determines sensitivity to semantic changes - more sensitive types create smaller, more focused chunks while less sensitive types create larger, more comprehensive chunks._"
