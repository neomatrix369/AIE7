            "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group .

            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability.

I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.

            "I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation.

Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",
            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with.

            "Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right.

            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

          "response": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan.

This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes.

It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts.",

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights.

I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI completed paying off my federal student loans. I had two loans with Mohela. Loan A says I owe {$26.00} and loan B - {$26.00}. I have a XXXX balance yet it states the I owe XXXX dollars on one of the loans and its due XX/XX/year>. Im afraid even though I owe nothing interest will start to accrue on loan A and I'll be labeled as a delinquent. I've attached a screenshot with proof of my complaint. \n\nCan you please request Mohela close my account? \n\nThank you\nDear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \n\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\n\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \n\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\n\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\n\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\n\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \n\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.\nThis is regarding my frustration and concern regarding the recent transfer of my federal student loan to XXXX and the lack of appropriate communication surrounding this change. \n\nTo be clear, I received XXXX email from the Department of Education notifying me of the transfer. After that, I only became aware of emails from \" XXXX ''. Given the frequency of spam and phishing attempts, this is not a reliable or appropriate method of communicating such a significant change. I received XXXX phone calls/voicemails, XXXX text messages, and XXXX mailed notices to my home address regarding the transfer of my student loan servicer. \n\nThe first truly official notice I received came in the form of a credit report update, showing my account as delinquent and causing my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. As someone with a pristine payment history, this is completely unacceptable and incredibly damaging. \n\nIt should go without saying that clear and proactive communication, especially regarding federal loan servicing, is a basic expectation. I am requesting immediate action to resolve this error and to correct the negative impact on my credit. Please confirm that this issue is being investigated and provide a timeline for resolution.",

              "context": "Subject : Request for Removal of Student Loans Due to Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ATTN : EDFINANCIAL I am writing to formally request the removal of student loans from my credit report due to a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, resulting from the unauthorized access of my Department of Education ( DOE ) records. These records were accessed and reported without my consent or proper authorization, which I believe violates my rights under the FCRA.\n\nDetails of the Student Loan Accounts : Loan Servicer ( s ) or Creditor ( s ) Name ( s ) : EdFinancial Services Account Number ( s ) : XXXX Reported Amount ( s ) : {$110000.00} As a result of this unauthorized access, the student loan ( s ) listed above were reported on my credit report inaccurately and without my permission. I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI completed paying off my federal student loans. I had two loans with Mohela. Loan A says I owe {$26.00} and loan B - {$26.00}. I have a XXXX balance yet it states the I owe XXXX dollars on one of the loans and its due XX/XX/year>. Im afraid even though I owe nothing interest will start to accrue on loan A and I'll be labeled as a delinquent. I've attached a screenshot with proof of my complaint. \n\nCan you please request Mohela close my account? \n\nThank you\nDear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \n\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\n\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \n\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\n\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\n\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\n\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \n\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.\nThis is regarding my frustration and concern regarding the recent transfer of my federal student loan to XXXX and the lack of appropriate communication surrounding this change. \n\nTo be clear, I received XXXX email from the Department of Education notifying me of the transfer. After that, I only became aware of emails from \" XXXX ''. Given the frequency of spam and phishing attempts, this is not a reliable or appropriate method of communicating such a significant change. I received XXXX phone calls/voicemails, XXXX text messages, and XXXX mailed notices to my home address regarding the transfer of my student loan servicer. \n\nThe first truly official notice I received came in the form of a credit report update, showing my account as delinquent and causing my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. As someone with a pristine payment history, this is completely unacceptable and incredibly damaging. \n\nIt should go without saying that clear and proactive communication, especially regarding federal loan servicing, is a basic expectation. I am requesting immediate action to resolve this error and to correct the negative impact on my credit. Please confirm that this issue is being investigated and provide a timeline for resolution.",

              "text": "Subject : Request for Removal of Student Loans Due to Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ATTN : EDFINANCIAL I am writing to formally request the removal of student loans from my credit report due to a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, resulting from the unauthorized access of my Department of Education ( DOE ) records. These records were accessed and reported without my consent or proper authorization, which I believe violates my rights under the FCRA.\n\nDetails of the Student Loan Accounts : Loan Servicer ( s ) or Creditor ( s ) Name ( s ) : EdFinancial Services Account Number ( s ) : XXXX Reported Amount ( s ) : {$110000.00} As a result of this unauthorized access, the student loan ( s ) listed above were reported on my credit report inaccurately and without my permission. I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI completed paying off my federal student loans. I had two loans with Mohela. Loan A says I owe {$26.00} and loan B - {$26.00}. I have a XXXX balance yet it states the I owe XXXX dollars on one of the loans and its due XX/XX/year>. Im afraid even though I owe nothing interest will start to accrue on loan A and I'll be labeled as a delinquent. I've attached a screenshot with proof of my complaint. \n\nCan you please request Mohela close my account? \n\nThank you\nDear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \n\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\n\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \n\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\n\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\n\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\n\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \n\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.\nThis is regarding my frustration and concern regarding the recent transfer of my federal student loan to XXXX and the lack of appropriate communication surrounding this change. \n\nTo be clear, I received XXXX email from the Department of Education notifying me of the transfer. After that, I only became aware of emails from \" XXXX ''. Given the frequency of spam and phishing attempts, this is not a reliable or appropriate method of communicating such a significant change. I received XXXX phone calls/voicemails, XXXX text messages, and XXXX mailed notices to my home address regarding the transfer of my student loan servicer. \n\nThe first truly official notice I received came in the form of a credit report update, showing my account as delinquent and causing my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. As someone with a pristine payment history, this is completely unacceptable and incredibly damaging. \n\nIt should go without saying that clear and proactive communication, especially regarding federal loan servicing, is a basic expectation. I am requesting immediate action to resolve this error and to correct the negative impact on my credit. Please confirm that this issue is being investigated and provide a timeline for resolution."

              "question": "What issues are being reported with Aidvantage regarding student loan repayment calculations?",
              "context": "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nI applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!\nXXXX, enacted in 1974, is designed to protect the privacy of student education records, restricting unauthorized access and disclosure.

However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent to certain parties or under specific conditions, such as : School officials with legitimate educational interests Other schools to which a student is transferring Accrediting organizations Compliance with a judicial order or subpoena.

              "context": "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nI applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!\nXXXX, enacted in 1974, is designed to protect the privacy of student education records, restricting unauthorized access and disclosure. Notably, XXXX does not XXXX individuals the right to sue for violations ; enforcement is the federal government 's responsibility. When i signed up for the income driven repayment plan it was a legal binding document recently A federal court issued an injunction preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans. The online income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plan and loan consolidation applications are available. My FERPA. XXXX XXXX was not and is not an elected official of the United States Government I am reaching out to provide important information regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( XXXX ) a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.\n\nWhat is FERPA?\n\nFERPA grants parents and eligible students ( those over XXXX  or attending a postsecondary institution ) the right to : 1. Inspect and review their education records maintained by the school. \nXXXX. Request corrections to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading. \n3. Control the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except under certain permitted conditions.\n\nWho Can Access Education Records?\n\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from a parent or eligible student to release any information from a students education record. However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent to certain parties or under specific conditions, such as : School officials with legitimate educational interests Other schools to which a student is transferring Accrediting organizations Compliance with a judicial order or subpoena. XXXX XXXX did not have XXXX order and or subpoena to have access to my student loan information.\n\nFERPA allows schools to disclose directory information ( such as a students name, address, and honors received ) without consent unless parents or eligible students opt out. Schools must inform families of this policy and provide time to request that directory information not be disclosed. The legal due process was not taken",

              "text": "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nI applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!\nXXXX, enacted in 1974, is designed to protect the privacy of student education records, restricting unauthorized access and disclosure. Notably, XXXX does not XXXX individuals the right to sue for violations ; enforcement is the federal government 's responsibility. When i signed up for the income driven repayment plan it was a legal binding document recently A federal court issued an injunction preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans.

XXXX XXXX was not and is not an elected official of the United States Government I am reaching out to provide important information regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( XXXX ) a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.\n\nWhat is FERPA?\n\nFERPA grants parents and eligible students ( those over XXXX  or attending a postsecondary institution ) the right to : 1. Inspect and review their education records maintained by the school. \nXXXX. Request corrections to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading. \n3. Control the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except under certain permitted conditions.\n\nWho Can Access Education Records?\n\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from a parent or eligible student to release any information from a students education record. However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent to certain parties or under specific conditions, such as : School officials with legitimate educational interests Other schools to which a student is transferring Accrediting organizations Compliance with a judicial order or subpoena. XXXX XXXX did not have XXXX order and or subpoena to have access to my student loan information.\n\nFERPA allows schools to disclose directory information ( such as a students name, address, and honors received ) without consent unless parents or eligible students opt out.

My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing this formal dispute my federal student loan obligations due to a significant breach of my personal and financial information.

This legal safeguard helps prevent data breaches by restricting how educational institutions, loan servicers, and federal agencies can share or release student information without proper authorization. In cases where personal and financial data are improperly shared or accessed without consent, FERPA provides a legal basis for borrowers to dispute such breaches and seek remedies, thereby helping to protect their privacy and reduce the risk of data breaches.",

I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing this formal dispute my federal student loan obligations due to a significant breach of my personal and financial information. My private data was compromised without my authorization, violating multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. Under the following legal protections my information should have been safeguarded : Family Education Rights and Privacy Act : Ensures the confidentiality of student records and prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.\n\nHigher Education Act : Establishes the responsibility of educational institutions and loan services to protect student data.\n\nPrivacy Act of XXXX  Prohibits the unauthorized sharing of personal information held by federal agencies.\n\nBreach of Contract : The unauthorized sharing of student loans borrowers ' personal and financial XXXX XXXX, constitutes a violation of the contractual obligations to protect borrower data. \nGiven the severity of this data breach and the failure to uphold federal protections, I formally request the immediate discharge and cancellation of my student loan dent in full. Please provide written confirmation of receipt of this dispute, as well as information regarding the next steps in the resolution process. \n\nI appreciate your time and prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Acct Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

              "question": "What issues are being raised regarding Nelnet in the consumer's complaint?",
              "context": "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years. I have served this country as a XXXX XXXX and a Therapist and even that doesnt qualify me for student loans repayments???? Nelnet make it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off their predatory loans. It is a XXXX and oppressive system that keeps non-white individuals like myself from truly succeeding.\nI am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.\nI have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.",

              "context": "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years. I have served this country as a XXXX XXXX and a Therapist and even that doesnt qualify me for student loans repayments???? Nelnet make it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off their predatory loans. It is a XXXX and oppressive system that keeps non-white individuals like myself from truly succeeding.\nI am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.\nI have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.",

              "text": "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years. I have served this country as a XXXX XXXX and a Therapist and even that doesnt qualify me for student loans repayments???? Nelnet make it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off their predatory loans. It is a XXXX and oppressive system that keeps non-white individuals like myself from truly succeeding.\nI am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.\nI have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

              "question": "What does it mean that I was told I am in forbearance until 2040 but I have no written proof and what should I do about the long wait and disconnection problems with my student loan lender?",
              "context": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?\nThank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.\nComplaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.",

              "context": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?\nThank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.\nComplaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.",

              "text": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?\nThank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.\nComplaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

              "answer": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Nelnet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Re : Immediate Cease & Desist of Student Loan Reporting and Collection Due to Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern, I am disputing the legitimacy and enforceability of the student loans associated with my account. As you are aware, XXXX XXXX has signed an executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, thereby creating a material legal void concerning all student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. \n# # # Demand for Verification & Cease and Desist Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ), I am requesting immediate verification of the legal ownership, servicing rights, and validity of the alleged student loan debt under your authority. Failure to provide this information within 30 days constitutes a direct violation of federal law. \nFurthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and FCRA, I am demanding the following : - Immediate cessation of collection efforts until full legal verification is provided. \n- A detailed breakdown of loan ownership and servicing rights post-Department of Education abolishment.\n\n- Written confirmation that you will cease reporting this unverified debt to credit bureaus. \nIf you fail to comply, I will escalate this matter to the CFPB, FTC, and pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

This request is based on the violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records, including personal and financial information.\n\nMy data was compromised and improperly disclosed, constituting a serious breach of FERPA. This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Nelnet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Re : Immediate Cease & Desist of Student Loan Reporting and Collection Due to Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern, I am disputing the legitimacy and enforceability of the student loans associated with my account.

              "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance.",

              "answer": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights because they highlight how failures in accurate data handling and clear communication can lead to significant issues for borrowers. For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

              "text": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance."

              "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
              "answer": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights because they highlight how failures in accurate data handling and clear communication can lead to significant issues for borrowers. For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

              "answer": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts.",

              "answer": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, which involved engaging in sham investigations and failing to conduct proper reinvestigations as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, directly relates to the misconduct observed in the handling of the disputed accounts. Specifically, despite the requirement to thoroughly investigate disputed items within 30 days and correct or delete inaccurate information, XXXX and XXXX failed to respond to consumer complaints and did not correct errors, some of which may have been deliberate acts of deception. Additionally, the account transferred to Nelnet was marked by acts of deception, errors, and violations of multiple consumer protection laws, including the FCRA. This pattern of misconduct underscores a systemic failure to adhere to legal obligations under the FCRA, highlighting the importance of proper investigations and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and unlawful practices."

              "answer": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling disputed accounts. Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights.

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nXX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly.

Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights.

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights.

It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights.

This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. \nGiven the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full. My amount is {$20000.00}\nI am writing to formally dispute my federal student loans and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without authorization, violating multiple federal laws to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the complete cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, in violation of FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections, and breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information were improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, in violation of the Higher Education Act. As a student borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections, in breach of Contract and Negligence. The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, risking my financial security with unauthorized disclosure to third parties.\nMy personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA, and your responsibility is to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student debt in full.\nThere has been unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. \n\nThese actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.",

The breach of FERPA, along with other laws like the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Higher Education Act, underscores the legal violations involved in the mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of your data, which supports your claim for legal dispute and resolution."

This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. \nGiven the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full. My amount is {$20000.00}\nI am writing to formally dispute my federal student loans and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without authorization, violating multiple federal laws to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the complete cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, in violation of FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections, and breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information were improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, in violation of the Higher Education Act. As a student borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections, in breach of Contract and Negligence. The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, risking my financial security with unauthorized disclosure to third parties.\nMy personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA, and your responsibility is to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student debt in full.\nThere has been unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. \n\nThese actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.",

This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. \nGiven the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full. My amount is {$20000.00}\nI am writing to formally dispute my federal student loans and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without authorization, violating multiple federal laws to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the complete cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, in violation of FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections, and breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information were improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, in violation of the Higher Education Act. As a student borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections, in breach of Contract and Negligence. The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, risking my financial security with unauthorized disclosure to third parties.\nMy personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA, and your responsibility is to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student debt in full.\nThere has been unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. \n\nThese actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards."

Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group .

            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.

I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own.

            "I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",
            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.",
            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

Here's what you should consider doing:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact your loan servicer in writing (via email or certified mail) to formally request documentation of your forbearance status, including the specific terms and duration. Keep records of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Account Online:** If possible, try to access your account through the official student loan portal to verify your current status, payment history, and any forbearance or deferment details.\n\n3. **File a Complaint or Seek Assistance:** If you're unable to get clear information or face ongoing issues, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can help resolve disputes with loan servicers.\n\n4. **Address Disconnection and Wait Times:** For long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours or using online chat or email options if available. Document your attempts to contact them.\n\n5. **Explore Alternative Contact Methods:** If phone contact is problematic, consider submitting a formal written inquiry or complaint through the Federal Student Aid website or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n6. **Legal and Consumer Protections:** Given the lack of transparency and potential miscommunication, consulting a legal professional or a student loan counselor might help clarify your rights and options.\n\n7. **Stay Informed:** Keep detailed records of all payments, communications, and attempts to resolve issues. This documentation can be useful if you need to escalate your case or seek legal advice.\n\nRemember, you do not have to accept verbal assurances alone\u2014request everything in writing for your records.

          "response": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

            "I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",

I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down.

          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights because they highlight how failures in accurate data handling and clear communication can lead to significant issues for borrowers. For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \n\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable.

According to consumer rights advocates, this impacts the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet in several ways:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Debt**: The abolishment of the Department of Education means that the legal ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of the student loans are now unverified or questionable. Loan servicers are failing to provide evidence of their legal rights to collect or report these debts.\n\n2. **Illegal Credit Reporting**: Credit bureaus continue to report these student loans despite their legal questionable status post-abolishment, which advocates argue is unlawful.\n\n3. **Failure to Verify**: Entities like Nelnet are accused of failing to verify the legitimacy of the debts they are reporting and collecting, violating laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\n4. **Legal Violations**: Consumer rights advocates claim that continuing collection efforts and credit reporting without proper verification constitute violations of federal laws, including:\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1681 (FCRA) \u2014 concerning the accuracy and verification of credit information.\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1692 (FDCPA) \u2014 concerning fair practices in debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education undermines the legal basis for the collection and reporting of certain student loans, and continuing these practices may involve violations of federal consumer protection laws.",

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights. This underscores the importance of robust enforcement and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and ensure fair credit reporting practices.",

          "reference": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer. Product: Student loan. Complaint Details: The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers."

Unauthorized Access and Reporting Violations:\n   - A consumer reported that EdFinancial Services accessed their Department of Education records without consent, leading to incorrect reporting of their student loans on their credit report.\n   - The consumer requested the removal of these loans due to violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\n\n2. Discrepancies in Loan Balances and Payment Status:\n   - A borrower who had completed paying off their federal student loans with Mohela found that their account still showed a balance of approximately $26 on two loans, causing concern about potential interest accrual and delinquency status.\n   - They requested the lender to close their account to prevent further issues.\n\n3. Misrepresentation and Mishandling of Loan Refunds:\n   - A consumer was told by EdFinancial that refunds of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance would not affect their loan forgiveness eligibility.\n   - After receiving a refund of $14,000, they believed their loan was settled, but later found their balance was reinstated to about $15,000 with interest, causing financial hardship.\n   - The company did not inform them that accepting the refund could reinstate the loan or accrue interest, leading to confusion and credit damage.\n\n4. Communication Failures During Loan Transfers:\n   - A borrower expressed frustration over the transfer of their federal student loan to a new servicer, with inadequate communication.\n   - They received emails from the Department of Education but only learned of the transfer through a credit report update, which negatively impacted their credit score.\n   - The consumer requested investigation and correction of this error.\n\n**Timeline of Events (as per complaints):**\n- COVID-19 forbearance period (dates unspecified): Borrowers made payments or received refunds based on assurances about forgiveness.\n- Post-forbearance period (dates unspecified): Loans were reported incorrectly, balances were reinstated, or transfers occurred without proper communication.\n- Specific complaint dates range from early April 2025, indicating these issues are recent and ongoing.\n\n**Specific Problems Faced:**\n- Unauthorized or incorrect reporting of loan status and balances.\n- Unexpected reinstatement of paid-off loans with interest.\n- Lack of clear, proactive communication about loan transfers and changes.\n- Damage to credit scores due to delayed or inadequate notification.\n- Financial hardship caused by misrepresented refund impacts and reinstated balances.\n\nIf you need more detailed information on a particular complaint or event, please let me know!",

Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group .

            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!",

            "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.",
            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",
            "I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!",

            "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.",
            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",
            "I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!",

            "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.",
            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",
            "I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!",

            "text": "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nI applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!\nXXXX, enacted in 1974, is designed to protect the privacy of student education records, restricting unauthorized access and disclosure. Notably, XXXX does not XXXX individuals the right to sue for violations ; enforcement is the federal government 's responsibility. When i signed up for the income driven repayment plan it was a legal binding document recently A federal court issued an injunction preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans. The online income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plan and loan consolidation applications are available. My FERPA. XXXX XXXX was not and is not an elected official of the United States Government I am reaching out to provide important information regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( XXXX ) a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.\n\nWhat is FERPA?\n\nFERPA grants parents and eligible students ( those over XXXX  or attending a postsecondary institution ) the right to : 1. Inspect and review their education records maintained by the school. \nXXXX. Request corrections to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading. \n3. Control the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except under certain permitted conditions.\n\nWho Can Access Education Records?\n\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from a parent or eligible student to release any information from a students education record. However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent to certain parties or under specific conditions, such as : School officials with legitimate educational interests Other schools to which a student is transferring Accrediting organizations Compliance with a judicial order or subpoena. XXXX XXXX did not have XXXX order and or subpoena to have access to my student loan information.\n\nFERPA allows schools to disclose directory information ( such as a students name, address, and honors received ) without consent unless parents or eligible students opt out. Schools must inform families of this policy and provide time to request that directory information not be disclosed. The legal due process was not taken"

            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date.

            "text": "Subject : Request for Removal of Student Loans Due to Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ATTN : EDFINANCIAL I am writing to formally request the removal of student loans from my credit report due to a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, resulting from the unauthorized access of my Department of Education ( DOE ) records. These records were accessed and reported without my consent or proper authorization, which I believe violates my rights under the FCRA.\n\nDetails of the Student Loan Accounts : Loan Servicer ( s ) or Creditor ( s ) Name ( s ) : EdFinancial Services Account Number ( s ) : XXXX Reported Amount ( s ) : {$110000.00} As a result of this unauthorized access, the student loan ( s ) listed above were reported on my credit report inaccurately and without my permission. I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI completed paying off my federal student loans. I had two loans with Mohela. Loan A says I owe {$26.00} and loan B - {$26.00}. I have a XXXX balance yet it states the I owe XXXX dollars on one of the loans and its due XX/XX/year>. Im afraid even though I owe nothing interest will start to accrue on loan A and I'll be labeled as a delinquent. I've attached a screenshot with proof of my complaint. \n\nCan you please request Mohela close my account? \n\nThank you\nDear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \n\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\n\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \n\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\n\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\n\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\n\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \n\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.\nThis is regarding my frustration and concern regarding the recent transfer of my federal student loan to XXXX and the lack of appropriate communication surrounding this change. \n\nTo be clear, I received XXXX email from the Department of Education notifying me of the transfer. After that, I only became aware of emails from \" XXXX ''. Given the frequency of spam and phishing attempts, this is not a reliable or appropriate method of communicating such a significant change. I received XXXX phone calls/voicemails, XXXX text messages, and XXXX mailed notices to my home address regarding the transfer of my student loan servicer. \n\nThe first truly official notice I received came in the form of a credit report update, showing my account as delinquent and causing my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. As someone with a pristine payment history, this is completely unacceptable and incredibly damaging. \n\nIt should go without saying that clear and proactive communication, especially regarding federal loan servicing, is a basic expectation. I am requesting immediate action to resolve this error and to correct the negative impact on my credit. Please confirm that this issue is being investigated and provide a timeline for resolution."

            "I am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years.

            "I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",
            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing this formal dispute my federal student loan obligations due to a significant breach of my personal and financial information.

Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years.

            "I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",
            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

            "I am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years.

            "I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",
            "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

            "Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration.

Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ).

            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

            "text": "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years. I have served this country as a XXXX XXXX and a Therapist and even that doesnt qualify me for student loans repayments???? Nelnet make it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off their predatory loans. It is a XXXX and oppressive system that keeps non-white individuals like myself from truly succeeding.\nI am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.\nI have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me."

I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",
            "Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.",
            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

Discrepancies in Loan Balances and Payment Status:\n   - A borrower who had completed paying off their federal student loans with Mohela found that their account still showed a balance of approximately $26 on two loans, causing concern about potential interest accrual and delinquency status.\n   - They requested the lender to close their account to prevent further issues.\n\n3. Misrepresentation and Mishandling of Loan Refunds:\n   - A consumer was told by EdFinancial that refunds of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance would not affect their loan forgiveness eligibility.\n   - After receiving a refund of $14,000, they believed their loan was settled, but later found their balance was reinstated to about $15,000 with interest, causing financial hardship.\n   - The company did not inform them that accepting the refund could reinstate the loan or accrue interest, leading to confusion and credit damage.\n\n4. Communication Failures During Loan Transfers:\n   - A borrower expressed frustration over the transfer of their federal student loan to a new servicer, with inadequate communication.\n   - They received emails from the Department of Education but only learned of the transfer through a credit report update, which negatively impacted their credit score.\n   - The consumer requested investigation and correction of this error.\n\n**Timeline of Events (as per complaints):**\n- COVID-19 forbearance period (dates unspecified): Borrowers made payments or received refunds based on assurances about forgiveness.\n- Post-forbearance period (dates unspecified): Loans were reported incorrectly, balances were reinstated, or transfers occurred without proper communication.\n- Specific complaint dates range from early April 2025, indicating these issues are recent and ongoing.\n\n**Specific Problems Faced:**\n- Unauthorized or incorrect reporting of loan status and balances.\n- Unexpected reinstatement of paid-off loans with interest.\n- Lack of clear, proactive communication about loan transfers and changes.\n- Damage to credit scores due to delayed or inadequate notification.\n- Financial hardship caused by misrepresented refund impacts and reinstated balances.\n\nIf you need more detailed information on a particular complaint or event, please let me know!",

            "context": "Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nI applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \n\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\n\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \n\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\n\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\n\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\n\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!\nXXXX, enacted in 1974, is designed to protect the privacy of student education records, restricting unauthorized access and disclosure. Notably, XXXX does not XXXX individuals the right to sue for violations ; enforcement is the federal government 's responsibility. When i signed up for the income driven repayment plan it was a legal binding document recently A federal court issued an injunction preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans. The online income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plan and loan consolidation applications are available. My FERPA. XXXX XXXX was not and is not an elected official of the United States Government I am reaching out to provide important information regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( XXXX ) a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.\n\nWhat is FERPA?\n\nFERPA grants parents and eligible students ( those over XXXX  or attending a postsecondary institution ) the right to : 1. Inspect and review their education records maintained by the school. \nXXXX. Request corrections to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading. \n3. Control the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except under certain permitted conditions.\n\nWho Can Access Education Records?\n\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from a parent or eligible student to release any information from a students education record. However, FERPA allows disclosure without consent to certain parties or under specific conditions, such as : School officials with legitimate educational interests Other schools to which a student is transferring Accrediting organizations Compliance with a judicial order or subpoena. XXXX XXXX did not have XXXX order and or subpoena to have access to my student loan information.\n\nFERPA allows schools to disclose directory information ( such as a students name, address, and honors received ) without consent unless parents or eligible students opt out. Schools must inform families of this policy and provide time to request that directory information not be disclosed. The legal due process was not taken",

The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",
            "Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.",
            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ).

            "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

          "response": "It sounds like you are in a difficult situation with your student loan, especially since you have no written proof of being in forbearance until 2040 and are experiencing communication and disconnection issues with your lender. Here's what you should consider doing:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact your loan servicer in writing (via email or certified mail) to formally request documentation of your forbearance status, including the specific terms and duration. Keep records of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Account Online:** If possible, try to access your account through the official student loan portal to verify your current status, payment history, and any forbearance or deferment details.\n\n3. **File a Complaint or Seek Assistance:** If you're unable to get clear information or face ongoing issues, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can help resolve disputes with loan servicers.\n\n4. **Address Disconnection and Wait Times:** For long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours or using online chat or email options if available. Document your attempts to contact them.\n\n5. **Explore Alternative Contact Methods:** If phone contact is problematic, consider submitting a formal written inquiry or complaint through the Federal Student Aid website or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n6. **Legal and Consumer Protections:** Given the lack of transparency and potential miscommunication, consulting a legal professional or a student loan counselor might help clarify your rights and options.\n\n7. **Stay Informed:** Keep detailed records of all payments, communications, and attempts to resolve issues. This documentation can be useful if you need to escalate your case or seek legal advice.\n\nRemember, you do not have to accept verbal assurances alone\u2014request everything in writing for your records. If your lender continues to be unresponsive or provides inconsistent information, reporting the issue to federal agencies like the CFPB or the Department of Education can also be helpful.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a student loan counselor or a consumer rights organization for personalized assistance.",

However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments."

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).\n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer.

As you are aware, President Trump has signed an executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, thereby creating a material legal void concerning all student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. \nDemand for Verification & Cease and Desist Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ), I am requesting immediate verification of the legal ownership, servicing rights, and validity of the alleged student loan debt under your authority.

This request is based on the violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records, including personal and financial information.\n\nMy data was compromised and improperly disclosed, constituting a serious breach of FERPA. This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Nelnet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Re : Immediate Cease & Desist of Student Loan Reporting and Collection Due to Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern, I am disputing the legitimacy and enforceability of the student loans associated with my account.

            "answer": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is relevant because the continued collection efforts and deceptive practices by the loan servicer, including the transfer of accounts and failure to respond to consumer complaints, violate protections under the FDCPA. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as ignoring certified mail complaints and engaging in deceptive acts, also breaches laws like the FDCPA, which aims to prevent unfair and abusive debt collection practices, especially when the student loans are legally void and the servicer's actions are questionable."

Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group .

          "response": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA."

            "context": "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the spouse of an XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being unfairly and unjustly targeted by Nelnet and XXXX XXXX Loans. Just being XXXX in XXXX, I am born with disadvantages. I was not born with the privilege of having a silver spoon in my mouth or the privilege of having parents who can pay for my education. I have had to work twice as hard or more within my career. I have a XXXX  AND a XXXX XXXX against all odds. Because I didnt have access to knowledge on student loans and such growing up, I had to figure it out all on my own. I didnt have guidance and the Department of Education failed to properly provide guidance into Federal Student loans and such. I was not afforded the education or resources to make an informed decision. I was utilizing the XXXX XXXX  my XXXX XXXX sponsor signed to me and was still pushed to get Federal Loans to complete my degree. I was under significant financial and XXXX  duress at the time because my spouse had just XXXX, 2 months after having our son. My grandmother, who raised me, died a few weeks into his XXXX. I was raising a XXXX  and a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. Nelnet is a predator loan servicing company who kept freely pushing for me to take loans without actually explaining anything. I was not in a right state of mind and Nelnet is a private company who profits off oppressed populations such as myself. They have not attempted to help me, their interest is set to keep XXXX, educated women like myself in financial distress. Nelnet is not an ethical company. I have worked with the XXXX Government for YEARS and have been a Federal XXXX for years. I have served this country as a XXXX XXXX and a Therapist and even that doesnt qualify me for student loans repayments???? Nelnet make it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off their predatory loans. It is a XXXX and oppressive system that keeps non-white individuals like myself from truly succeeding.\nI am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.\nI have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.",

Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \n\nWhat Happened? \nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \n\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \n\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \n\nI received no response. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \n\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \n\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \n\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \n\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \n\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \n\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness.",

In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

The misconduct by Nelnet, such as ignoring certified mail complaints and engaging in deceptive acts, also breaches laws like the FDCPA, which aims to prevent unfair and abusive debt collection practices, especially when the student loans are legally void and the servicer's actions are questionable."

These records were accessed and reported without my consent or proper authorization, which I believe violates my rights under the FCRA.\n\nDetails of the Student Loan Accounts : Loan Servicer ( s ) or Creditor ( s ) Name ( s ) : EdFinancial Services Account Number ( s ) : XXXX Reported Amount ( s ) : {$110000.00} As a result of this unauthorized access, the student loan ( s ) listed above were reported on my credit report inaccurately and without my permission. I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI completed paying off my federal student loans. I had two loans with Mohela. Loan A says I owe {$26.00} and loan B - {$26.00}. I have a XXXX balance yet it states the I owe XXXX dollars on one of the loans and its due XX/XX/year>. Im afraid even though I owe nothing interest will start to accrue on loan A and I'll be labeled as a delinquent. I've attached a screenshot with proof of my complaint. \n\nCan you please request Mohela close my account? \n\nThank you\nDear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \n\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\n\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \n\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\n\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\n\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\n\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \n\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.\nThis is regarding my frustration and concern regarding the recent transfer of my federal student loan to XXXX and the lack of appropriate communication surrounding this change. \n\nTo be clear, I received XXXX email from the Department of Education notifying me of the transfer. After that, I only became aware of emails from \" XXXX ''. Given the frequency of spam and phishing attempts, this is not a reliable or appropriate method of communicating such a significant change. I received XXXX phone calls/voicemails, XXXX text messages, and XXXX mailed notices to my home address regarding the transfer of my student loan servicer. \n\nThe first truly official notice I received came in the form of a credit report update, showing my account as delinquent and causing my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. As someone with a pristine payment history, this is completely unacceptable and incredibly damaging. \n\nIt should go without saying that clear and proactive communication, especially regarding federal loan servicing, is a basic expectation. I am requesting immediate action to resolve this error and to correct the negative impact on my credit. Please confirm that this issue is being investigated and provide a timeline for resolution.",

          "response": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA."

This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided.

This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information.

However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.",

As you are aware, President Trump has signed an executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, thereby creating a material legal void concerning all student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. \nDemand for Verification & Cease and Desist Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ), I am requesting immediate verification of the legal ownership, servicing rights, and validity of the alleged student loan debt under your authority. Failure to provide this information within 30 days constitutes a direct violation of federal law. \nFurthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and FCRA, I am demanding the following : - Immediate cessation of collection efforts until full legal verification is provided. \n- A detailed breakdown of loan ownership and servicing rights post-Department of Education abolishment.\n\n- Written confirmation that you will cease reporting this unverified debt to credit bureaus.\n\nIf you fail to comply, I will escalate this matter to the CFPB, FTC, and pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan debt and request full cancellation of my outstanding balance. This request is based on the violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records, including personal and financial information.\n\nMy data was compromised and improperly disclosed, constituting a serious breach of FERPA. This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Nelnet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Re : Immediate Cease & Desist of Student Loan Reporting and Collection Due to Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern, I am disputing the legitimacy and enforceability of the student loans associated with my account. As you are aware, XXXX XXXX has signed an executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, thereby creating a material legal void concerning all student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. \n# # # Demand for Verification & Cease and Desist Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ), I am requesting immediate verification of the legal ownership, servicing rights, and validity of the alleged student loan debt under your authority. Failure to provide this information within 30 days constitutes a direct violation of federal law. \nFurthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and FCRA, I am demanding the following : - Immediate cessation of collection efforts until full legal verification is provided. \n- A detailed breakdown of loan ownership and servicing rights post-Department of Education abolishment.\n\n- Written confirmation that you will cease reporting this unverified debt to credit bureaus. \nIf you fail to comply, I will escalate this matter to the CFPB, FTC, and pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

          "response": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

            "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
            "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance.",
            "answer": "The cases highlight that Aidvantage has failed to process the borrower\u2019s income-based repayment application correctly, resulting in an incorrect payment amount despite proper documentation, and also failed to confirm the autopay setup, leading to overdue notices. These issues demonstrate the critical need for Aidvantage to ensure accurate processing of applications and clear communication with borrowers to prevent unjust billing, protect consumer rights, and avoid negative credit impacts."

            "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",
            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights because they highlight how failures in accurate data handling and clear communication can lead to significant issues for borrowers. For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship."

            "context": "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

Unauthorized Access and Reporting Violations:\n   - A consumer reported that EdFinancial Services accessed their Department of Education records without consent, leading to incorrect reporting of their student loans on their credit report.\n   - The consumer requested the removal of these loans due to violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\n\n2. Discrepancies in Loan Balances and Payment Status:\n   - A borrower who had completed paying off their federal student loans with Mohela found that their account still showed a balance of approximately $26 on two loans, causing concern about potential interest accrual and delinquency status.\n   - They requested the lender to close their account to prevent further issues.\n\n3. Misrepresentation and Mishandling of Loan Refunds:\n   - A consumer was told by EdFinancial that refunds of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance would not affect their loan forgiveness eligibility.\n   - After receiving a refund of $14,000, they believed their loan was settled, but later found their balance was reinstated to about $15,000 with interest, causing financial hardship.\n   - The company did not inform them that accepting the refund could reinstate the loan or accrue interest, leading to confusion and credit damage.\n\n4. Communication Failures During Loan Transfers:\n   - A borrower expressed frustration over the transfer of their federal student loan to a new servicer, with inadequate communication.\n   - They received emails from the Department of Education but only learned of the transfer through a credit report update, which negatively impacted their credit score.\n   - The consumer requested investigation and correction of this error.\n\n**Timeline of Events (as per complaints):**\n- COVID-19 forbearance period (dates unspecified): Borrowers made payments or received refunds based on assurances about forgiveness.\n- Post-forbearance period (dates unspecified): Loans were reported incorrectly, balances were reinstated, or transfers occurred without proper communication.\n- Specific complaint dates range from early April 2025, indicating these issues are recent and ongoing.\n\n**Specific Problems Faced:**\n- Unauthorized or incorrect reporting of loan status and balances.\n- Unexpected reinstatement of paid-off loans with interest.\n- Lack of clear, proactive communication about loan transfers and changes.\n- Damage to credit scores due to delayed or inadequate notification.\n- Financial hardship caused by misrepresented refund impacts and reinstated balances.\n\nIf you need more detailed information on a particular complaint or event, please let me know!",

            "answer": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

These records were accessed and reported without my consent or proper authorization, which I believe violates my rights under the FCRA.\n\nDetails of the Student Loan Accounts : Loan Servicer ( s ) or Creditor ( s ) Name ( s ) : EdFinancial Services Account Number ( s ) : XXXX Reported Amount ( s ) : {$110000.00} As a result of this unauthorized access, the student loan ( s ) listed above were reported on my credit report inaccurately and without my permission. I believe that these actions are in direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which requires consumer consent for the access and reporting of certain personal information, including student loan data.\n\nI request the immediate removal of these student loans from my credit report due to the following reasons : 1. The DOE records were accessed without my consent or proper authorization.\n\n2. This unauthorized reporting constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). \nI kindly ask that you investigate this issue and remove the student loan accounts from my credit report as required by the FCRA. Please notify me once the investigation is complete, and provide a copy of any corrected information. \nIf you require further documentation or clarification to proceed with this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",

The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance."

            "context": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?\nThank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.\nComplaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.",

            "text": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance."

            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights because they highlight how failures in accurate data handling and clear communication can lead to significant issues for borrowers. For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

            "context": "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.\n\nFurthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.\n\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.\n\nExamine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.\n\nDetermine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.\n\nTake legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.\n\nI urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \n\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally request the forgiveness and removal of student loan debt from my credit report due to multiple serious factors impacting the validity and integrity of these loans. \n\nFirst and foremost, my personal and financial information was compromised, and I am currently dealing with active cases of identity theft and fraudulent activity. I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance.",

          "reference": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

            "answer": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

According to consumer rights advocates, this impacts the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet in several ways:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Debt**: The abolishment of the Department of Education means that the legal ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of the student loans are now unverified or questionable. Loan servicers are failing to provide evidence of their legal rights to collect or report these debts.\n\n2. **Illegal Credit Reporting**: Credit bureaus continue to report these student loans despite their legal questionable status post-abolishment, which advocates argue is unlawful.\n\n3. **Failure to Verify**: Entities like Nelnet are accused of failing to verify the legitimacy of the debts they are reporting and collecting, violating laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\n4. **Legal Violations**: Consumer rights advocates claim that continuing collection efforts and credit reporting without proper verification constitute violations of federal laws, including:\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1681 (FCRA) \u2014 concerning the accuracy and verification of credit information.\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1692 (FDCPA) \u2014 concerning fair practices in debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education undermines the legal basis for the collection and reporting of certain student loans, and continuing these practices may involve violations of federal consumer protection laws."

For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

            "context": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is a federal law that governs the conduct of debt collectors, including their practices in collecting debts and reporting information about debts. In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations in several ways:\n\n1. **Protection Against Unverified Debt Collection:** The consumer in the complaints is requesting verification of the legitimacy and enforceability of their student loans under the FDCPA (specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g). This law requires debt collectors to provide proof of debt upon request and prohibits collection activities until verification is provided. Nelnet's continued reporting and collection efforts without verifying the debt may violate these provisions.\n\n2. **Ceasing Collection Efforts:** The consumer demands that Nelnet cease collection efforts until proper verification is received, which aligns with the FDCPA's protections against unfair practices.\n\n3. **Misleading and Deceptive Practices:** The complaints highlight allegations that Nelnet is reporting unverified or legally questionable debts, which could constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under the FDCPA.\n\n4. **Illegal Credit Reporting:** The complaints also mention violations of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act), which, while separate, often work in tandem with the FDCPA to protect consumers from inaccurate or unfair credit reporting related to debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA is relevant here because it provides consumers with the legal right to challenge and verify debts, and to prevent debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices\u2014including reporting debts that are legally void or unverified following the abolishment of the Department of Education's authority over certain student loans. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as continuing to report and attempt to collect on debts that are now legally questionable, may constitute violations of these consumer protections under the FDCPA.",

Here's what you should consider doing:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact your loan servicer in writing (via email or certified mail) to formally request documentation of your forbearance status, including the specific terms and duration. Keep records of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Account Online:** If possible, try to access your account through the official student loan portal to verify your current status, payment history, and any forbearance or deferment details.\n\n3. **File a Complaint or Seek Assistance:** If you're unable to get clear information or face ongoing issues, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can help resolve disputes with loan servicers.\n\n4. **Address Disconnection and Wait Times:** For long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours or using online chat or email options if available. Document your attempts to contact them.\n\n5. **Explore Alternative Contact Methods:** If phone contact is problematic, consider submitting a formal written inquiry or complaint through the Federal Student Aid website or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n6. **Legal and Consumer Protections:** Given the lack of transparency and potential miscommunication, consulting a legal professional or a student loan counselor might help clarify your rights and options.\n\n7. **Stay Informed:** Keep detailed records of all payments, communications, and attempts to resolve issues. This documentation can be useful if you need to escalate your case or seek legal advice.\n\nRemember, you do not have to accept verbal assurances alone\u2014request everything in writing for your records. If your lender continues to be unresponsive or provides inconsistent information, reporting the issue to federal agencies like the CFPB or the Department of Education can also be helpful.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a student loan counselor or a consumer rights organization for personalized assistance.",

I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with.

According to consumer rights advocates, this impacts the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet in several ways:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Debt**: The abolishment of the Department of Education means that the legal ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of the student loans are now unverified or questionable. Loan servicers are failing to provide evidence of their legal rights to collect or report these debts.\n\n2. **Illegal Credit Reporting**: Credit bureaus continue to report these student loans despite their legal questionable status post-abolishment, which advocates argue is unlawful.\n\n3. **Failure to Verify**: Entities like Nelnet are accused of failing to verify the legitimacy of the debts they are reporting and collecting, violating laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\n4. **Legal Violations**: Consumer rights advocates claim that continuing collection efforts and credit reporting without proper verification constitute violations of federal laws, including:\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1681 (FCRA) \u2014 concerning the accuracy and verification of credit information.\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1692 (FDCPA) \u2014 concerning fair practices in debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education undermines the legal basis for the collection and reporting of certain student loans, and continuing these practices may involve violations of federal consumer protection laws."

          "reference": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

          "response": "The Department of Education's abolishment creates a significant legal void concerning student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. According to consumer rights advocates, this impacts the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet in several ways:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Debt**: The abolishment of the Department of Education means that the legal ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of the student loans are now unverified or questionable. Loan servicers are failing to provide evidence of their legal rights to collect or report these debts.\n\n2. **Illegal Credit Reporting**: Credit bureaus continue to report these student loans despite their legal questionable status post-abolishment, which advocates argue is unlawful.\n\n3. **Failure to Verify**: Entities like Nelnet are accused of failing to verify the legitimacy of the debts they are reporting and collecting, violating laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\n4. **Legal Violations**: Consumer rights advocates claim that continuing collection efforts and credit reporting without proper verification constitute violations of federal laws, including:\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1681 (FCRA) \u2014 concerning the accuracy and verification of credit information.\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1692 (FDCPA) \u2014 concerning fair practices in debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education undermines the legal basis for the collection and reporting of certain student loans, and continuing these practices may involve violations of federal consumer protection laws.",

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling disputed accounts. Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights.

For example, in the first complaint, despite submitting income documentation correctly, the borrower was assigned an incorrect repayment amount and was told their application had not been processed, which contradicts the billing they received. This indicates a lack of proper processing and oversight, resulting in potential financial hardship and confusion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case involving autopay setup issues, the borrower was not properly notified of the transfer of their loan servicing or the failure to carry over automatic payments, leading to negative credit impacts. The lack of effective communication about these changes and the mishandling of account information undermine borrower rights to transparency and fair treatment.\n\nTogether, these cases demonstrate that proper processing ensures accurate application of borrower information, while effective communication keeps borrowers informed about their loan status and any changes. When these processes are neglected, it can result in incorrect billing, default reporting, or missed payments, which can harm borrowers financially and legally. Therefore, these issues underscore the critical need for Aidvantage to improve its processing accuracy and communication practices to uphold borrower rights and prevent unnecessary hardship.",

After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights. This underscores the importance of robust enforcement and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and ensure fair credit reporting practices."

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling disputed accounts. Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights. This underscores the importance of robust enforcement and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and ensure fair credit reporting practices.",

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nXX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and Metro 2 Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \n2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \n3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \n4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nXX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly.

My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights. This underscores the importance of robust enforcement and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and ensure fair credit reporting practices.",

For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.",

My amount is {$20000.00}\nI am writing to formally dispute my federal student loans and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without authorization, violating multiple federal laws to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the complete cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, in violation of FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections, and breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information were improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, in violation of the Higher Education Act. As a student borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections, in breach of Contract and Negligence. The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, risking my financial security with unauthorized disclosure to third parties.\nMy personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA, and your responsibility is to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student debt in full.\nThere has been unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. \n\nThese actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.",

This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",

This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \n\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.\n\n2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have\nincorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\n\n3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",

These actions constitute violations of FERPA because they involve the improper use or disclosure of your protected student records without your authorization.\n\nThis breach of FERPA rights is also linked to broader violations of federal laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Higher Education Act, which aim to safeguard your personal and financial information. The improper use of your student loan report and the breach of your personal info can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and a loss of privacy, all of which are serious concerns addressed by these laws.\n\nIn summary, the violation of FERPA relates to the improper use and unauthorized disclosure of your student records and personal information, which has resulted in a breach of your privacy rights and the mishandling of your data.",

My information was compromised without authorization, violating multiple federal laws to protect student records and personal privacy.

Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, in violation of FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections, and breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information were improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, in violation of the Higher Education Act. As a student borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections, in breach of Contract and Negligence. The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, risking my financial security with unauthorized disclosure to third parties.\nMy personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization.

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that these companies engaged in superficial or \"sham\" investigations, which means they did not genuinely verify the accuracy of the disputed information or take appropriate corrective actions as required by law. \n\nUnder the FCRA, companies like XXXX and Nelnet are legally obligated to conduct thorough and reasonable reinvestigations within 30 days when a consumer disputes information on their credit report (15 U.S.C. 1681i). Failure to do so, especially when investigations are superficial or deliberately misleading, constitutes a violation of consumer rights. The misconduct includes not only failing to verify disputed information but also neglecting to update or correct inaccurate data, and in some cases, deliberately covering up errors or continuing to report inaccurate information despite clear evidence of disputes.\n\nThis misconduct has serious implications for consumer protection under the FCRA. It undermines the purpose of the law, which is to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. When companies engage in sham investigations and ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate credit reports that can harm their creditworthiness, ability to obtain loans, or other financial opportunities. It also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to prevent such misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the failure of XXXX and Nelnet to properly investigate disputes, coupled with sham investigations, exemplifies violations of the FCRA that compromise consumer rights.

            "context": "Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \n\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \n\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \n\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \n\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \n\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \n\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \n\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \n\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \n\nThank you for your time and effort.",

Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\nFinancial & Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score.",

This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \n\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \n\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \n\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \n\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \n\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",

According to consumer rights advocates, this impacts the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet in several ways:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Debt**: The abolishment of the Department of Education means that the legal ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of the student loans are now unverified or questionable. Loan servicers are failing to provide evidence of their legal rights to collect or report these debts.\n\n2. **Illegal Credit Reporting**: Credit bureaus continue to report these student loans despite their legal questionable status post-abolishment, which advocates argue is unlawful.\n\n3. **Failure to Verify**: Entities like Nelnet are accused of failing to verify the legitimacy of the debts they are reporting and collecting, violating laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\n4. **Legal Violations**: Consumer rights advocates claim that continuing collection efforts and credit reporting without proper verification constitute violations of federal laws, including:\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1681 (FCRA) \u2014 concerning the accuracy and verification of credit information.\n   - 15 U.S.C. 1692 (FDCPA) \u2014 concerning fair practices in debt collection.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education undermines the legal basis for the collection and reporting of certain student loans, and continuing these practices may involve violations of federal consumer protection laws.",

Failure to provide this information within 30 days constitutes a direct violation of federal law. \nFurthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and FCRA, I am demanding the following : - Immediate cessation of collection efforts until full legal verification is provided. \n- A detailed breakdown of loan ownership and servicing rights post-Department of Education abolishment.\n\n- Written confirmation that you will cease reporting this unverified debt to credit bureaus.\n\nIf you fail to comply, I will escalate this matter to the CFPB, FTC, and pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights.",

            "context": "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.",

            "context": "I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \n\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \n\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me.",

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

            "context": "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.",

The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer.

            "context": "Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \n\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\n\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \n\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \n\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\n\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \n\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \n\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.",

This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.",

This violation not only undermines the legitimacy of the loan servicing process in my case but also contributes to the broader pattern of misconduct already established against XXXX. \n\nI am aware of the lawsuit filed against XXXX  by various state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which accused the company of deceptive practices, including steering borrowers into costly forbearance, misrepresenting payment options, and failing to provide clear and accurate information. These findings further support my position that the management of my loans has been unlawful and unethical. \n\nRecently, I noticed a significant decrease in my credit scoreover XXXX pointsand upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that my student loan account was reported in a misleading and inaccurate manner. \n\nI have been enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan for several years, which should not negatively impact my credit score. However, the account has been reported as if it was in default, which is false and does not reflect my current repayment status. As per the guidelines of the IDR plan, the loan should not be reported as negative on my credit report, but it has been, causing significant harm to my credit standing. \n\nIt appears that this misreporting is due to XXXX inaccurate reporting practices, and I believe this issue is tied to the ongoing legal matters involving XXXX, which were recently publicized.",

I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance.",

I have been advised that, under these circumstances, I may qualify for programs that offer full loan discharge and the removal of affected loans from my credit report. \n\nIn addition to the compromise of my information, the school associated with these loans has since been shut down. This closure was reportedly due to : Widespread compromise of student records and personal information ; Ongoing lawsuits involving misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement by the institution. \nThese developments raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of how my loans were originated and managed. Given the combination of : The schools closure and legal action, The compromise of sensitive information held by the institution, And the direct impact on my identity and credit, I am requesting a full investigation into my student loan history, as well as consideration for complete loan forgiveness and removal from my credit report under federal borrower defense and data breach-related discharge guidelines. \n\nI have attached documentation to support my claims, including identity theft reports and references to the schools closure and legal proceedings. I would appreciate written confirmation of receipt and guidance on how to move forward with this process. \n\nThank you for your time, understanding, and assistance.",

            "context": "XX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \nXXXX. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \nXXXX. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \nXXXX. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while XXXX XXXX and XXXX applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

As you are aware, XXXX XXXX has signed an executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, thereby creating a material legal void concerning all student loan obligations previously managed under its authority. \n# # # Demand for Verification & Cease and Desist Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ), I am requesting immediate verification of the legal ownership, servicing rights, and validity of the alleged student loan debt under your authority. Failure to provide this information within 30 days constitutes a direct violation of federal law. \nFurthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and FCRA, I am demanding the following : - Immediate cessation of collection efforts until full legal verification is provided. \n- A detailed breakdown of loan ownership and servicing rights post-Department of Education abolishment.\n\n- Written confirmation that you will cease reporting this unverified debt to credit bureaus. \nIf you fail to comply, I will escalate this matter to the CFPB, FTC, and pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \nXXXX. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \nXXXX. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \nXXXX. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while XXXX XXXX and XXXX applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \n2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \n3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \n4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "context": "XX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and Metro 2 Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \n2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \n3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \n4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).\n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer.
