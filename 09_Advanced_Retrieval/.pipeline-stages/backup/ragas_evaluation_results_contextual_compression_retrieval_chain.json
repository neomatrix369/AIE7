          "retrieved_contexts": [
            "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",
            "My loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time.

I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with.

            "Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.",
            "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

          "response": "The Department of Education's abolishment significantly impacts the legality of student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet. According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

              "question": "Can you please provide me with the detailed Complaint Details regarding the issue with my student loan payments after the COVID-19 forbearance ended, including the specific problems faced and the timeline of events?",
              "context": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt.",
              "answer": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer. Product: Student loan. Complaint Details: The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers."

              "context": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt.",

              "text": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

              "question": "What issues are being reported with Aidvantage regarding student loan repayment calculations?",
              "context": "This matter relates to a student loan I took out for my XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who is attending XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, VA. The first loan proceeds were originally issued on XX/XX/year>, in the amount of {$25000.00}. \n\nDuring the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments of {$250.00} for a total of {$750.00} in payments. These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time. This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied. When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\nI submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",
              "answer": "The customer reports that Aidvantage assigned a monthly payment amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on their income, despite the borrower submitting their IDR recertification on time and in full. Aidvantage has not processed the application yet, yet they issued a bill based on a recalculation, which contradicts the fact that the application has not been processed. The borrower requests a correction of the repayment amount, an explanation of the calculation, assurance against delinquency or negative credit reporting during the dispute, and an investigation into why borrowers are being billed before their applications are processed."

When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\nI submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",

There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?"

On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nIm writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.\nI applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",

Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can assist in resolving issues with loan servicers and can help clarify your loan status.\n\n4. **Document All Communications:** Keep detailed records of all your attempts to contact MOHELA, including dates, times, and summaries of conversations or messages sent.\n\n5. **Addressing Wait and Disconnection Problems:** Since you are experiencing long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours, or use email or online messaging if available. You can also submit inquiries through the official contact forms or customer service portals.\n\n6. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check your loan account and official federal student aid websites for updates on your loan status and any notices about forbearance or repayment plans.\n\nRemember, if you suspect you are not in the correct status or if your lender is unresponsive, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman can intervene on your behalf.",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nIm writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.\nI applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

              "answer": "It sounds like you have been given verbal information that you are in forbearance until 2040, but you do not have any written documentation to confirm this. Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can assist in resolving issues with loan servicers and can help clarify your loan status.\n\n4. **Document All Communications:** Keep detailed records of all your attempts to contact MOHELA, including dates, times, and summaries of conversations or messages sent.\n\n5. **Addressing Wait and Disconnection Problems:** Since you are experiencing long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours, or use email or online messaging if available. You can also submit inquiries through the official contact forms or customer service portals.\n\n6. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check your loan account and official federal student aid websites for updates on your loan status and any notices about forbearance or repayment plans.\n\nRemember, if you suspect you are not in the correct status or if your lender is unresponsive, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman can intervene on your behalf.",

In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations because it prohibits debt collectors from engaging in practices such as attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid or legally enforceable.\n\nIn the complaints provided, consumers allege that Nelnet continues to report and attempt to collect student loans that have become legally questionable or void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. These actions may violate the FDCPA if Nelnet is engaging in collection efforts without verifying the legitimacy of the debt or if they are reporting debts that are no longer valid, thereby engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\n\nSpecifically, the violations include:\n- Continuing to report and collect debts that are unverified or legally void.\n- Failing to provide evidence of legal ownership or collection rights.\n- Engaging in collection practices that mislead or deceive consumers about the validity of their debts.\n\nTherefore, the FDCPA provides consumers with protections against such misconduct, allowing them to challenge unfair collection practices and seek legal remedies for violations related to the illegal reporting and collection of student loans by Nelnet.",

              "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
              "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

              "answer": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

              "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

              "text": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition."

              "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
              "answer": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

              "answer": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

              "question": "How does the Department of Education's abolishment impact the legality of student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet, and what legal violations are involved according to consumer rights advocates?",
              "answer": "The Department of Education's abolishment significantly impacts the legality of student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet. According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid.

              "context": "I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",
              "answer": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, which involved engaging in sham investigations and failing to conduct proper reinvestigations as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, directly relates to the misconduct observed in the handling of the disputed accounts. Specifically, despite the requirement to thoroughly investigate disputed items within 30 days and correct or delete inaccurate information, XXXX and XXXX failed to respond to consumer complaints and did not correct errors, some of which may have been deliberate acts of deception. Additionally, the account transferred to Nelnet was marked by acts of deception, errors, and violations of multiple consumer protection laws, including the FCRA. This pattern of misconduct underscores a systemic failure to adhere to legal obligations under the FCRA, highlighting the importance of proper investigations and accountability to protect consumers from inaccurate reporting and unlawful practices."

              "context": "I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

            "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",
            "My loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

Lack of Proper Notification:  \n   - You did not receive formal or sufficient notices from your loan servicer (Nelnet and others) about the end of the forbearance or the start of repayment.  \n   - The only indications were unfamiliar phone calls, which you ignored for security reasons, and no official written or electronic notices were provided.\n\n2. Inaccurate and Harmful Credit Reporting:  \n   - Your loans exited deferment without proper communication, yet late payments were reported all at once, indicating delinquency despite no prior warning or billing statements.  \n   - Your credit score was negatively impacted due to these reported delinquencies, which you believe were improperly reported.\n\n3. Sudden Servicing Transition and Lack of Explanation:  \n   - Your account was transferred from Nelnet to another servicer (XXXX) and placed into forbearance without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability.\n\n4. Discrepancies in Account Status and Payment History:  \n   - You received notices indicating delinquency (15 days, then 45 days past due) without prior billing statements or warnings.  \n   - The first indication of repayment issues was through notices stating you were already overdue, which you did not expect.\n\n5. Efforts to Address the Issue:  \n   - You wrote to both Nelnet and the new servicer requesting a goodwill credit adjustment.  \n   - You filed complaints with your attorney\u2019s office.  \n   - You disputed the late payments with credit bureaus.\n\n6. Timeline of Events (as per your account):  \n   - Long period of deferment (exact duration unspecified).  \n   - Without clear notice, loans exited deferment, and delinquency was reported.  \n   - You made a payment of $500 on a specific date (XX/XX/2025), bringing your account current.  \n   - The next day (XX/XX/2025), your account was transferred and placed into forbearance without explanation.  \n   - You received notices of delinquency after the fact, with no prior warning.\n\nAdditional complaints mention issues such as improper handling of notifications, reporting delinquencies without proper notice, and a lack of billing statements or payment schedules, which contributed to the confusion and credit damage.\n\nPlease note that some specific dates and details are marked as \"XX/XX/XXXX\" or \"XXXX\" in the complaints, indicating placeholders or redacted information.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific documentation, please let me know!",

            "Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.",
            "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group.

            "I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX.

Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \n\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \n\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable. The data being reported by your bureau in relation to the \" DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN '' tradeline is now under legal dispute due to illegality of origin and breach of contract. Continued furnishing or reinsertion of this information without legal justification or lawful verification constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law, making your agency liable under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. \n\nNelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. \n\nAny delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified.

According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

Specifically, under the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681i), companies are legally required to perform thorough, reasonable reinvestigations of consumer disputes within 30 days and to correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information promptly. \n\nIn the provided context, the CFPB alleges that XXXX and XXXX engaged in sham investigations\u2014meaning they conducted superficial or insincere inquiries that did not genuinely verify the disputed information\u2014and failed to conduct proper reinvestigations. This misconduct resulted in continued inaccuracies on consumers' credit reports, despite disputes and evidence provided by consumers. Similarly, Nelnet's handling of disputed accounts involved errors, deception, and a failure to respond appropriately to consumer complaints, including ignoring certified mail and not correcting known errors.\n\nThese actions constitute violations of the FCRA because they undermine the law's core protections, which are designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of consumer credit information. The failure to conduct proper investigations and the engagement in sham investigations not only perpetuate inaccurate reporting but also violate consumers' rights to dispute and correct erroneous information.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection are significant: such misconduct erodes trust in credit reporting systems, allows inaccurate information to harm consumers' creditworthiness, and potentially leads to unlawful adverse actions based on false data. It highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA's investigative requirements and underscores the importance of holding furnishers and credit reporting agencies accountable to prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers' rights under federal law.",

In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable.

            "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

            "context": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt.",

The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position.

However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position.

            "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",
            "My loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers."

            "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",
            "My loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

          "response": "Based on the complaint details provided, the issues faced with your student loan payments after the COVID-19 forbearance ended include:\n\n1. Lack of Proper Notification:  \n   - You did not receive formal or sufficient notices from your loan servicer (Nelnet and others) about the end of the forbearance or the start of repayment.  \n   - The only indications were unfamiliar phone calls, which you ignored for security reasons, and no official written or electronic notices were provided.\n\n2. Inaccurate and Harmful Credit Reporting:  \n   - Your loans exited deferment without proper communication, yet late payments were reported all at once, indicating delinquency despite no prior warning or billing statements.  \n   - Your credit score was negatively impacted due to these reported delinquencies, which you believe were improperly reported.\n\n3. Sudden Servicing Transition and Lack of Explanation:  \n   - Your account was transferred from Nelnet to another servicer (XXXX) and placed into forbearance without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability.\n\n4. Discrepancies in Account Status and Payment History:  \n   - You received notices indicating delinquency (15 days, then 45 days past due) without prior billing statements or warnings.  \n   - The first indication of repayment issues was through notices stating you were already overdue, which you did not expect.\n\n5. Efforts to Address the Issue:  \n   - You wrote to both Nelnet and the new servicer requesting a goodwill credit adjustment.  \n   - You filed complaints with your attorney\u2019s office.  \n   - You disputed the late payments with credit bureaus.\n\n6. Timeline of Events (as per your account):  \n   - Long period of deferment (exact duration unspecified).  \n   - Without clear notice, loans exited deferment, and delinquency was reported.  \n   - You made a payment of $500 on a specific date (XX/XX/2025), bringing your account current.  \n   - The next day (XX/XX/2025), your account was transferred and placed into forbearance without explanation.  \n   - You received notices of delinquency after the fact, with no prior warning.\n\nAdditional complaints mention issues such as improper handling of notifications, reporting delinquencies without proper notice, and a lack of billing statements or payment schedules, which contributed to the confusion and credit damage.\n\nPlease note that some specific dates and details are marked as \"XX/XX/XXXX\" or \"XXXX\" in the complaints, indicating placeholders or redacted information.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific documentation, please let me know!",

The first loan proceeds were originally issued on XX/XX/year>, in the amount of {$25000.00}. \n\nDuring the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments of {$250.00} for a total of {$750.00} in payments. These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time. This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied.

I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments?

The first loan proceeds were originally issued on XX/XX/year>, in the amount of {$25000.00}. \n\nDuring the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments of {$250.00} for a total of {$750.00} in payments. These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time. This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied. When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\nI submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",

This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied. When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX",
            "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",
            "I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?"
          ],
          "response": "The issues being reported with Aidvantage regarding student loan repayment calculations include:\n\n1. Payments Not Being Recorded: Borrowers made payments to previous servicers, but Aidvantage shows no record of these payments being applied to their accounts.\n\n2. Incorrect Payment Amounts: Borrowers recertified income and expected to be assigned a payment amount based on their income, but Aidvantage assigned a higher, seemingly incorrect amount, and has not processed their applications properly.\n\n3. Billing Discrepancies: Aidvantage billed borrowers for repayment amounts before their income-driven repayment (IDR) applications were processed, leading to confusion and contradictions.\n\n4. Application of Payments During Forbearance: Borrowers are unsure if their payments during forbearance are being correctly applied to their balances, especially since some report their balances have increased despite making payments.\n\n5. Difficulty in Tracking Payments and Balances: Borrowers find it challenging to verify whether their payments are being received and applied correctly, and why their balances are changing.\n\nOverall, the complaints highlight issues with payment application, billing accuracy, and proper calculation of repayment amounts based on income.",

Inaccurate and Harmful Credit Reporting:  \n   - Your loans exited deferment without proper communication, yet late payments were reported all at once, indicating delinquency despite no prior warning or billing statements.  \n   - Your credit score was negatively impacted due to these reported delinquencies, which you believe were improperly reported.\n\n3. Sudden Servicing Transition and Lack of Explanation:  \n   - Your account was transferred from Nelnet to another servicer (XXXX) and placed into forbearance without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability.\n\n4. Discrepancies in Account Status and Payment History:  \n   - You received notices indicating delinquency (15 days, then 45 days past due) without prior billing statements or warnings.  \n   - The first indication of repayment issues was through notices stating you were already overdue, which you did not expect.\n\n5. Efforts to Address the Issue:  \n   - You wrote to both Nelnet and the new servicer requesting a goodwill credit adjustment.  \n   - You filed complaints with your attorney\u2019s office.  \n   - You disputed the late payments with credit bureaus.\n\n6. Timeline of Events (as per your account):  \n   - Long period of deferment (exact duration unspecified).  \n   - Without clear notice, loans exited deferment, and delinquency was reported.  \n   - You made a payment of $500 on a specific date (XX/XX/2025), bringing your account current.  \n   - The next day (XX/XX/2025), your account was transferred and placed into forbearance without explanation.  \n   - You received notices of delinquency after the fact, with no prior warning.\n\nAdditional complaints mention issues such as improper handling of notifications, reporting delinquencies without proper notice, and a lack of billing statements or payment schedules, which contributed to the confusion and credit damage.\n\nPlease note that some specific dates and details are marked as \"XX/XX/XXXX\" or \"XXXX\" in the complaints, indicating placeholders or redacted information.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific documentation, please let me know!"

The first loan proceeds were originally issued on XX/XX/year>, in the amount of {$25000.00}. \n\nDuring the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments of {$250.00} for a total of {$750.00} in payments. These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time. This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied. When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\nI submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?"

            "text": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt."

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.",
            "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

            "context": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nIm writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.\nI applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

            "context": "This matter relates to a student loan I took out for my XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who is attending XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, VA. The first loan proceeds were originally issued on XX/XX/year>, in the amount of {$25000.00}. \n\nDuring the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I made monthly payments of {$250.00} for a total of {$750.00} in payments. These payments were made to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), which was servicing the student loan at the time. This loan was subsequently transferred to Aidvantage, which shows no record of these payments being made on their portal. \n\nI contacted Aidvantage on numerous occassions to resolve this matter. I also provided bank statements for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  showing the disbursement of funds to XXXX. Aidvantage advised me that these payments were applied, but couldn't show me any records to demonstrate payments were, in fact, applied. When I view the account history on Aidvantage 's portal there are no payments shown for XXXX  at all. \n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX\nI submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?",

Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can assist in resolving issues with loan servicers and can help clarify your loan status.\n\n4. **Document All Communications:** Keep detailed records of all your attempts to contact MOHELA, including dates, times, and summaries of conversations or messages sent.\n\n5. **Addressing Wait and Disconnection Problems:** Since you are experiencing long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours, or use email or online messaging if available. You can also submit inquiries through the official contact forms or customer service portals.\n\n6. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check your loan account and official federal student aid websites for updates on your loan status and any notices about forbearance or repayment plans.\n\nRemember, if you suspect you are not in the correct status or if your lender is unresponsive, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman can intervene on your behalf."

            "Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.",
            "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR.

'' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.",
            "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation."

          "response": "It sounds like you have been given verbal information that you are in forbearance until 2040, but you do not have any written documentation to confirm this. Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can assist in resolving issues with loan servicers and can help clarify your loan status.\n\n4. **Document All Communications:** Keep detailed records of all your attempts to contact MOHELA, including dates, times, and summaries of conversations or messages sent.\n\n5. **Addressing Wait and Disconnection Problems:** Since you are experiencing long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours, or use email or online messaging if available. You can also submit inquiries through the official contact forms or customer service portals.\n\n6. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check your loan account and official federal student aid websites for updates on your loan status and any notices about forbearance or repayment plans.\n\nRemember, if you suspect you are not in the correct status or if your lender is unresponsive, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman can intervene on your behalf.",

The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position.

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\nSubject : Complaint Against Student Loan Servicer, NELNET for Misconduct XXXX. Loan Servicer Information : Servicer Name : Nelnet Type of Loan : Federal XXXX. Nature of Complaint : Select all that apply : Incorrect loan balance reported Misapplied or missing payments Wrongful denial of repayment plan ( e.g., Income-Driven Repayment ) Other : Charging interest on subsidized loans while borrower is in in-school deferment XXXX. Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}. My in-school deferment was wrongfully denied, despite meeting the eligibility requirements. \n\nXXXX.

In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations because it prohibits debt collectors from engaging in practices such as attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid or legally enforceable.\n\nIn the complaints provided, consumers allege that Nelnet continues to report and attempt to collect student loans that have become legally questionable or void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.

Incorrect Payment Amounts: Borrowers recertified income and expected to be assigned a payment amount based on their income, but Aidvantage assigned a higher, seemingly incorrect amount, and has not processed their applications properly.\n\n3. Billing Discrepancies: Aidvantage billed borrowers for repayment amounts before their income-driven repayment (IDR) applications were processed, leading to confusion and contradictions.\n\n4. Application of Payments During Forbearance: Borrowers are unsure if their payments during forbearance are being correctly applied to their balances, especially since some report their balances have increased despite making payments.\n\n5. Difficulty in Tracking Payments and Balances: Borrowers find it challenging to verify whether their payments are being received and applied correctly, and why their balances are changing.\n\nOverall, the complaints highlight issues with payment application, billing accuracy, and proper calculation of repayment amounts based on income.",

            "context": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nMy loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \n\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \n\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' with no explanation of what that means. \n\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt.",

            "context": "Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nIm writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \n\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \n\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year>, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year>, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year>, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year>. \n\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year>. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \n\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.\nI applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",

In the context of the illegal student loan reporting and misconduct by Nelnet, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations because it prohibits debt collectors from engaging in practices such as attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid or legally enforceable.\n\nIn the complaints provided, consumers allege that Nelnet continues to report and attempt to collect student loans that have become legally questionable or void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. These actions may violate the FDCPA if Nelnet is engaging in collection efforts without verifying the legitimacy of the debt or if they are reporting debts that are no longer valid, thereby engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\n\nSpecifically, the violations include:\n- Continuing to report and collect debts that are unverified or legally void.\n- Failing to provide evidence of legal ownership or collection rights.\n- Engaging in collection practices that mislead or deceive consumers about the validity of their debts.\n\nTherefore, the FDCPA provides consumers with protections against such misconduct, allowing them to challenge unfair collection practices and seek legal remedies for violations related to the illegal reporting and collection of student loans by Nelnet.",

This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",

            "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process."

Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

These actions may violate the FDCPA if Nelnet is engaging in collection efforts without verifying the legitimacy of the debt or if they are reporting debts that are no longer valid, thereby engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\n\nSpecifically, the violations include:\n- Continuing to report and collect debts that are unverified or legally void.\n- Failing to provide evidence of legal ownership or collection rights.\n- Engaging in collection practices that mislead or deceive consumers about the validity of their debts.\n\nTherefore, the FDCPA provides consumers with protections against such misconduct, allowing them to challenge unfair collection practices and seek legal remedies for violations related to the illegal reporting and collection of student loans by Nelnet.",

            "text": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition."

            "answer": "These cases illustrate the critical importance of proper processing and clear communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \n\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \n\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \n\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \n\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX",

The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances."

The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

Without written proof, it can be difficult to verify your status or resolve disputes with your lender. I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Request Written Confirmation:** Contact MOHELA again, preferably in writing (via email or certified mail), and formally request written documentation of your forbearance status until 2040. Keep copies of all correspondence.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account through the official portal to see if your loan status reflects the forbearance. If you cannot log in or your account does not show the correct status, document these issues.\n\n3. **File a Complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman:** If you continue to experience unhelpful responses, long wait times, or disconnections, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group. They can assist in resolving issues with loan servicers and can help clarify your loan status.\n\n4. **Document All Communications:** Keep detailed records of all your attempts to contact MOHELA, including dates, times, and summaries of conversations or messages sent.\n\n5. **Addressing Wait and Disconnection Problems:** Since you are experiencing long wait times and disconnections, try calling during off-peak hours, or use email or online messaging if available. You can also submit inquiries through the official contact forms or customer service portals.\n\n6. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check your loan account and official federal student aid websites for updates on your loan status and any notices about forbearance or repayment plans.\n\nRemember, if you suspect you are not in the correct status or if your lender is unresponsive, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman can intervene on your behalf.",

            "context": "I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nComplaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

Lack of Proper Notification:  \n   - You did not receive formal or sufficient notices from your loan servicer (Nelnet and others) about the end of the forbearance or the start of repayment.  \n   - The only indications were unfamiliar phone calls, which you ignored for security reasons, and no official written or electronic notices were provided.\n\n2. Inaccurate and Harmful Credit Reporting:  \n   - Your loans exited deferment without proper communication, yet late payments were reported all at once, indicating delinquency despite no prior warning or billing statements.  \n   - Your credit score was negatively impacted due to these reported delinquencies, which you believe were improperly reported.\n\n3. Sudden Servicing Transition and Lack of Explanation:  \n   - Your account was transferred from Nelnet to another servicer (XXXX) and placed into forbearance without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability.\n\n4. Discrepancies in Account Status and Payment History:  \n   - You received notices indicating delinquency (15 days, then 45 days past due) without prior billing statements or warnings.  \n   - The first indication of repayment issues was through notices stating you were already overdue, which you did not expect.\n\n5. Efforts to Address the Issue:  \n   - You wrote to both Nelnet and the new servicer requesting a goodwill credit adjustment.  \n   - You filed complaints with your attorney\u2019s office.  \n   - You disputed the late payments with credit bureaus.\n\n6. Timeline of Events (as per your account):  \n   - Long period of deferment (exact duration unspecified).  \n   - Without clear notice, loans exited deferment, and delinquency was reported.  \n   - You made a payment of $500 on a specific date (XX/XX/2025), bringing your account current.  \n   - The next day (XX/XX/2025), your account was transferred and placed into forbearance without explanation.  \n   - You received notices of delinquency after the fact, with no prior warning.\n\nAdditional complaints mention issues such as improper handling of notifications, reporting delinquencies without proper notice, and a lack of billing statements or payment schedules, which contributed to the confusion and credit damage.\n\nPlease note that some specific dates and details are marked as \"XX/XX/XXXX\" or \"XXXX\" in the complaints, indicating placeholders or redacted information.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific documentation, please let me know!",

Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances."

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}. My in-school deferment was wrongfully denied, despite meeting the eligibility requirements. \n\nXXXX.

          "response": "The Department of Education's abolishment significantly impacts the legality of student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet. According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts.",

Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.",
            "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.",

This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \n\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

            "I am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling disputed accounts. Specifically, under the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681i), companies are legally required to perform thorough, reasonable reinvestigations of consumer disputes within 30 days and to correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information promptly. \n\nIn the provided context, the CFPB alleges that XXXX and XXXX engaged in sham investigations\u2014meaning they conducted superficial or insincere inquiries that did not genuinely verify the disputed information\u2014and failed to conduct proper reinvestigations. This misconduct resulted in continued inaccuracies on consumers' credit reports, despite disputes and evidence provided by consumers. Similarly, Nelnet's handling of disputed accounts involved errors, deception, and a failure to respond appropriately to consumer complaints, including ignoring certified mail and not correcting known errors.\n\nThese actions constitute violations of the FCRA because they undermine the law's core protections, which are designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of consumer credit information. The failure to conduct proper investigations and the engagement in sham investigations not only perpetuate inaccurate reporting but also violate consumers' rights to dispute and correct erroneous information.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection are significant: such misconduct erodes trust in credit reporting systems, allows inaccurate information to harm consumers' creditworthiness, and potentially leads to unlawful adverse actions based on false data. It highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA's investigative requirements and underscores the importance of holding furnishers and credit reporting agencies accountable to prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers' rights under federal law.",

After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

            "answer": "The Department of Education's abolishment significantly impacts the legality of student loan reporting and collection practices by entities like Nelnet. According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

            "answer": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling disputed accounts. Specifically, under the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681i), companies are legally required to perform thorough, reasonable reinvestigations of consumer disputes within 30 days and to correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information promptly. \n\nIn the provided context, the CFPB alleges that XXXX and XXXX engaged in sham investigations\u2014meaning they conducted superficial or insincere inquiries that did not genuinely verify the disputed information\u2014and failed to conduct proper reinvestigations. This misconduct resulted in continued inaccuracies on consumers' credit reports, despite disputes and evidence provided by consumers. Similarly, Nelnet's handling of disputed accounts involved errors, deception, and a failure to respond appropriately to consumer complaints, including ignoring certified mail and not correcting known errors.\n\nThese actions constitute violations of the FCRA because they undermine the law's core protections, which are designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of consumer credit information. The failure to conduct proper investigations and the engagement in sham investigations not only perpetuate inaccurate reporting but also violate consumers' rights to dispute and correct erroneous information.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection are significant: such misconduct erodes trust in credit reporting systems, allows inaccurate information to harm consumers' creditworthiness, and potentially leads to unlawful adverse actions based on false data. It highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA's investigative requirements and underscores the importance of holding furnishers and credit reporting agencies accountable to prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers' rights under federal law.",

Accurate and Timely Processing: The first complaint highlights how Aidvantage assigned an incorrect repayment amount despite the borrower submitting proper income documentation and the application being in process. This demonstrates that failure to properly process applications can lead to incorrect billing, causing confusion and potential financial hardship for borrowers. Proper processing ensures that borrowers are billed accurately based on their actual income and repayment plans.\n\n2. Clear and Consistent Communication: Both complaints reveal issues with inadequate notification\u2014such as not informing borrowers of loan transfers or servicing changes, and not providing copies of transfer notices. Lack of communication can result in missed payments, negative credit reporting, and borrower frustration. Effective communication is essential to keep borrowers informed about their loan status, changes in servicing, and billing details.\n\n3. Preventing Systemic Errors and Ensuring Accountability: The repeated systemic errors and inconsistent responses from Aidvantage show the need for robust internal processes and accountability. Proper processing and transparent communication help prevent systemic mistakes, reduce borrower distress, and uphold borrower rights.\n\n4. Protecting Borrower Credit and Rights: The placement of loans into forbearance without proper explanation, and billing errors despite unprocessed applications, can negatively impact credit scores and eligibility for programs like PSLF. Proper handling and communication safeguard borrowers from unintended negative consequences.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent processing and transparent, proactive communication are vital for safeguarding borrower rights, ensuring fair treatment, and maintaining trust in the student loan servicing process.",

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet concerning the misreporting of my federal student loan account. Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

According to consumer rights advocates, the executive order to abolish the Department of Education creates a legal void concerning the ownership, servicing rights, and enforceability of student loans previously managed under its authority. \n\nAs a result, continued reporting and collection efforts on these loans are considered legally questionable and potentially unlawful. Advocates argue that without the Department's authority, entities like Nelnet may be engaging in practices that violate federal laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Specifically, these violations include:\n\n- Reporting unverified or questionable debt to credit bureaus without proper legal ownership or verification.\n- Failing to provide evidence of the legitimacy of the debt after the Department's abolishment.\n- Continuing collection efforts on debts that are now legally void, which may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.\n\nConsumers have filed complaints demanding investigation, verification of debt legitimacy, and cessation of collection activities, asserting that ongoing collection and reporting efforts violate their rights under federal laws. The legal implications involve potential violations of the FDCPA and FCRA, and advocates suggest that these practices could be challenged legally due to the absence of the Department's authority to enforce or validate these debts post-abolishment.\n\nPlease note that the legal landscape may evolve, and specific cases can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances.",

Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

            "context": "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",

            "context": "I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",

Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

Specifically, under the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681i), companies are legally required to perform thorough, reasonable reinvestigations of consumer disputes within 30 days and to correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information promptly. \n\nIn the provided context, the CFPB alleges that XXXX and XXXX engaged in sham investigations\u2014meaning they conducted superficial or insincere inquiries that did not genuinely verify the disputed information\u2014and failed to conduct proper reinvestigations. This misconduct resulted in continued inaccuracies on consumers' credit reports, despite disputes and evidence provided by consumers. Similarly, Nelnet's handling of disputed accounts involved errors, deception, and a failure to respond appropriately to consumer complaints, including ignoring certified mail and not correcting known errors.\n\nThese actions constitute violations of the FCRA because they undermine the law's core protections, which are designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of consumer credit information. The failure to conduct proper investigations and the engagement in sham investigations not only perpetuate inaccurate reporting but also violate consumers' rights to dispute and correct erroneous information.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection are significant: such misconduct erodes trust in credit reporting systems, allows inaccurate information to harm consumers' creditworthiness, and potentially leads to unlawful adverse actions based on false data. It highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA's investigative requirements and underscores the importance of holding furnishers and credit reporting agencies accountable to prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers' rights under federal law.",

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).\n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action.\n\nRespectfully,",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. \n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates.

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. \n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX",

Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. \n\nThis action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), once a consumer disputes the accuracy of any reported information, the furnisher is legally obligated to conduct a reasonable investigation and promptly correct any inaccuracies found. \n\nI have made all required loan payments on time and in full, and I have documentation to prove this. Nelnets failure to correct this errordespite my repeated efforts to resolve it directlyconstitutes not only negligence but potential willful noncompliance with federal consumer protection laws. \n\nI respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and compel Nelnet to : Immediately correct the inaccurate delinquency report with all credit reporting agencies. \n\nNotify all affected credit bureaus of the correction as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). \n\nProvide written confirmation of the correction and explanation for the initial error. \n\nThe misreporting has already caused material harm to my financial standing, including diminished access to credit and potentially higher interest rates. I seek a full remedy and restoration of my credit profile as it existed prior to this incorrect delinquency report. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",
