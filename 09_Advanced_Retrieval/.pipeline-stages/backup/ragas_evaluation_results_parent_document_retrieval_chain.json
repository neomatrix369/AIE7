            "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint.

            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer."

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs.

            "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance.

            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.",

I had no idea I was supposed to start paying again on the loans until I received a credit alert on my report, to which I immediately called them on XX/XX/year> and made my account current ( had I known they were in repayment by phone/email/mail, I would have immediately enrolled in auto pay ). Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days. There was no attempt to reach out or report on 30+ day delinquencies."

My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \n\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \n\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable.

These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting.",

Specifically, despite the requirement to thoroughly investigate disputed items within 30 days and correct or delete inaccurate information, XXXX and XXXX failed to respond to consumer complaints and did not correct errors, some of which may have been deliberate acts of deception. Additionally, the account transferred to Nelnet was marked by acts of deception, errors, and violations of multiple consumer protection laws, including the FCRA.

However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations.

            "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action.

My information was compromised without my authorization, which violates multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt in full, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request ; Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, violating FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections.\n\nBreach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without my authorization'ating my privacy riahts under federai law. Violation of the Higher Education Act ; As a student loan borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections.\n\nBreach of Contract and Negligence ; The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, putting my financial security at risk. And unauthorized disclosure to third parties",
            "<2-hop>\n\nThis is a formal legal demand for immediate investigation and permanent deletion of all student loan accounts reported under the tradeline \" DEPT OF XXXX, '' which is NELNET, XXXX my credit report. These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. \n\nIt has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \n\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \n\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable. The data being reported by your bureau in relation to the \" DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN '' tradeline is now under legal dispute due to illegality of origin and breach of contract. Continued furnishing or reinsertion of this information without legal justification or lawful verification constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law, making your agency liable under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. \n\nNelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. \n\nAny delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. \n\nYou have been formally notified."

              "context": "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",

However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position.

              "context": "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",

              "text": "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer."

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count.

              "text": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI initially had XXXX as my student loan provider but decided to consolidate my loans and chose AidVantage as the provider. The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year> with first payment due on XX/XX/year>. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I paid off my student loans in XXXX The Department of education/aidvantage keeps asking me for money. I had contacted a representative at aidvantage letting them know that I have documentation from the bank and they had made an error. Whoever I spoke with said that they would look into it, but aidvantage is still asking me for money and ruining my credit score."

              "context": "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The family education rights and privacy act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality od student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was accessed without my authorization by a third party not affiliated with the issuer of my student loans. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

              "context": "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The family education rights and privacy act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality od student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was accessed without my authorization by a third party not affiliated with the issuer of my student loans. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

              "text": "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The family education rights and privacy act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality od student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was accessed without my authorization by a third party not affiliated with the issuer of my student loans. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

              "context": "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Several things are going on with Nelnet. \n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.",

My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation.

              "text": "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Several things are going on with Nelnet. \n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem."

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI got a subsidized loan. After having issues with the university I was attending I took a semester off to transfer to a new school. In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.\nIn a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end.

Keep records of all communications.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account again, possibly using a different device or clearing your browser cache, to see if the current forbearance status and end date are reflected there.\n\n3. **Dispute Any Discrepancies:** If your online account shows a different end date than what you were told, or if you receive conflicting information, formally dispute the discrepancy with your servicer and request a written explanation.\n\n4. **Address Communication Issues:** Since you've experienced trouble logging in and long wait times, consider reaching out via certified mail or through your loan servicer\u2019s official contact channels to ensure your requests are documented.\n\n5. **Seek Assistance:** If your servicer is unresponsive or provides inconsistent information, you can contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for further assistance.\n\nRegarding the long wait and disconnection problems:\n\n- **Try calling during off-peak hours** to reduce wait times.\n- **Use online chat or email options** if available.\n- **File a complaint** with the CFPB if you experience persistent issues with customer service or transparency.\n\nRemember, without written proof, your best course is to obtain official documentation directly from your loan servicer and keep detailed records of all interactions.",

              "text": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI got a subsidized loan. After having issues with the university I was attending I took a semester off to transfer to a new school. In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.\nIn a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved."

              "context": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nSubject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a former complaint against AidVantage, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1.

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately.

              "answer": "The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that governs the behavior of third-party debt collectors and aims to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. In the context of the complaints involving Nelnet and illegal student loan reporting, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations when debt collectors or loan servicers engage in misconduct, such as misrepresenting account status, continuing collection efforts after debts are invalid or settled, or engaging in deceptive practices.\n\nFrom the provided complaints, Nelnet's actions\u2014such as refusing to update account statuses after settlement, continuing to report delinquent accounts despite evidence of payment or settlement, and engaging in collection activities on legally void or unverified debts\u2014may violate provisions of the FDCPA. These violations include misrepresenting the amount or status of a debt, failing to cease collection efforts after the debt is settled or invalid, and using deceptive practices to collect or report debts.\n\nAdditionally, the complaints highlight violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), such as inaccurate credit reporting and failure to correct erroneous information, which are also protected under consumer rights laws.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA relates to these violations by providing consumers with protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices by loan servicers like Nelnet. When Nelnet continues collection activities or reports inaccurate information despite evidence of settlement or invalidity, it may be engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA, thereby violating consumer rights.",

              "context": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nSubject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a former complaint against AidVantage, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1.

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.",

              "text": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer.

              "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
              "context": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan.

              "question": "Based on the issues reported with Aidvantage, including the incorrect student loan repayment amount despite proper submission of income documentation and the autopay setup problems, how do these cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage to protect borrower rights?",
              "answer": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

              "context": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Aidvantage did not do its due diligence to make sure they had my accurate info before reaching out about the status of my loans going into repayment.

For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

              "text": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Aidvantage did not do its due diligence to make sure they had my accurate info before reaching out about the status of my loans going into repayment. I had no idea I was supposed to start paying again on the loans until I received a credit alert on my report, to which I immediately called them on XX/XX/year> and made my account current ( had I known they were in repayment by phone/email/mail, I would have immediately enrolled in auto pay ). Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days. There was no attempt to reach out or report on 30+ day delinquencies."

              "answer": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

Consumer advocates and complainants argue that once the Department of Education was abolished, the student loans that were previously managed or overseen by it became legally void or unverified. \n\nThe impact includes:\n- Continued reporting of student loans to credit bureaus that are now considered unverified and legally questionable.\n- Ongoing collection efforts by entities like Nelnet despite the loans' legal status being in question following the abolishment.\n- Failure by loan servicers to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations after the Department's dissolution.\n\nLegal violations involved, according to consumer rights advocates, include:\n- Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681), particularly regarding the reporting of unverified or questionable debts.\n- Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692), especially related to unfair and deceptive collection practices and the failure to verify the legitimacy of the debts.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education has led to claims that continued collection and reporting practices are illegal and violate consumer rights, as the debts are now considered legally void or unverified.",

Consumer advocates and complainants argue that once the Department of Education was abolished, the student loans that were previously managed or overseen by it became legally void or unverified. \n\nThe impact includes:\n- Continued reporting of student loans to credit bureaus that are now considered unverified and legally questionable.\n- Ongoing collection efforts by entities like Nelnet despite the loans' legal status being in question following the abolishment.\n- Failure by loan servicers to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations after the Department's dissolution.\n\nLegal violations involved, according to consumer rights advocates, include:\n- Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681), particularly regarding the reporting of unverified or questionable debts.\n- Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692), especially related to unfair and deceptive collection practices and the failure to verify the legitimacy of the debts.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education has led to claims that continued collection and reporting practices are illegal and violate consumer rights, as the debts are now considered legally void or unverified.",

The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid.

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX.

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

              "question": "How does the violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, relate to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling the disputed accounts, and what implications does this have for consumer protection under the FCRA?",
              "answer": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling the disputed accounts. Specifically, these entities failed to fulfill their legal obligations under the FCRA to conduct reasonable and thorough reinvestigations when consumers disputed the accuracy of their credit information. Instead of properly verifying and correcting the disputed data, they engaged in practices such as sham investigations\u2014meaning investigations that are superficial or intentionally misleading\u2014and neglected to update or correct inaccurate reporting.\n\nThis misconduct is evident in the consumer complaints where TransUnion and other furnishers continued to report inaccurate account statuses, such as defaulted loans despite evidence of settlement or discharge, and failed to document ongoing disputes. For example, Nelnet's refusal to settle accounts despite receipt of negotiable instruments, and TransUnion\u2019s continued reporting of disputed accounts without proper investigation, exemplify these failures.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection under the FCRA are significant. These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting.",

              "question": "How does the violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) relate to the improper use of my student loan report and the breach of my personal info?",
              "context": "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter. You may contact me via phone or email to discuss this dispute further. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised WITHOUT my authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, ( FERPA ), protects the confidentiality of Student Records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and resulting compromise to my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised without authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach clearly violates FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise on my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

When this law is violated, it means that your educational records or PII have been accessed, disclosed, or handled without proper authorization or your consent.\n\nIn the context of your complaints, the improper use of your student loan report and the breach of your personal info are considered violations of FERPA because they involve unauthorized disclosures or mishandling of your private educational and financial data. Such breaches can lead to unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or fraud, and undermine your rights to privacy and data security.\n\nTherefore, FERPA violations relate to these issues by indicating that your rights to confidentiality and proper data handling were not upheld, resulting in the exposure and misuse of your personal and loan-related information."

              "text": "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter. You may contact me via phone or email to discuss this dispute further. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised WITHOUT my authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, ( FERPA ), protects the confidentiality of Student Records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and resulting compromise to my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised without authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach clearly violates FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise on my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter."

            "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count.

            "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer."

            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet.

This indicates problems with how payments are processed and recorded.\n\n2. **Failure to Transfer Auto-Pay Information:** Borrowers reported that their automatic payment setups were not transferred properly during the servicing transition, leading to missed payments and negative credit impacts.\n\n3. **Miscalculations of Payment Amounts:** There are reports of gross miscalculations of monthly payments, especially for borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, with Aidvantage admitting to systemic errors that resulted in incorrect payment quotes.\n\n4. **Lack of Proper Notification and Communication:** Several complaints highlight inadequate notification about servicing transfers and changes, which affected auto-pay setups and payment processing.\n\nOverall, these issues point to systemic problems with payment calculations, processing, and communication during the transition to Aidvantage's servicing.",

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4.

My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total.

          "response": "The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that governs the behavior of third-party debt collectors and aims to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. In the context of the complaints involving Nelnet and illegal student loan reporting, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations when debt collectors or loan servicers engage in misconduct, such as misrepresenting account status, continuing collection efforts after debts are invalid or settled, or engaging in deceptive practices.\n\nFrom the provided complaints, Nelnet's actions\u2014such as refusing to update account statuses after settlement, continuing to report delinquent accounts despite evidence of payment or settlement, and engaging in collection activities on legally void or unverified debts\u2014may violate provisions of the FDCPA. These violations include misrepresenting the amount or status of a debt, failing to cease collection efforts after the debt is settled or invalid, and using deceptive practices to collect or report debts.\n\nAdditionally, the complaints highlight violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), such as inaccurate credit reporting and failure to correct erroneous information, which are also protected under consumer rights laws.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA relates to these violations by providing consumers with protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices by loan servicers like Nelnet. When Nelnet continues collection activities or reports inaccurate information despite evidence of settlement or invalidity, it may be engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA, thereby violating consumer rights.",

            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.",

I had no idea I was supposed to start paying again on the loans until I received a credit alert on my report, to which I immediately called them on XX/XX/year> and made my account current ( had I known they were in repayment by phone/email/mail, I would have immediately enrolled in auto pay ). Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days. There was no attempt to reach out or report on 30+ day delinquencies."

My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \n\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \n\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \n\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \n\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.",

I thought because it was a weekend, I had to wait until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, to check the status in case it was going to be posted on the next business day and I did not want to risk submitting a manual payment only to then get deducted via autopay. I spoke to an agent via chat and via the phone and both people told me it was autopay set up was incomplete and it didn't process for this month. You would think 20 days is enough time, and I did not receive any kind of notification that it was not set up yet."

          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

          "response": "Based on the provided complaints, the abolishment of the U.S. Department of Education appears to impact the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices. Consumer advocates and complainants argue that once the Department of Education was abolished, the student loans that were previously managed or overseen by it became legally void or unverified. \n\nThe impact includes:\n- Continued reporting of student loans to credit bureaus that are now considered unverified and legally questionable.\n- Ongoing collection efforts by entities like Nelnet despite the loans' legal status being in question following the abolishment.\n- Failure by loan servicers to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations after the Department's dissolution.\n\nLegal violations involved, according to consumer rights advocates, include:\n- Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681), particularly regarding the reporting of unverified or questionable debts.\n- Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692), especially related to unfair and deceptive collection practices and the failure to verify the legitimacy of the debts.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education has led to claims that continued collection and reporting practices are illegal and violate consumer rights, as the debts are now considered legally void or unverified.",

          "reference": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts.",

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling the disputed accounts. Specifically, these entities failed to fulfill their legal obligations under the FCRA to conduct reasonable and thorough reinvestigations when consumers disputed the accuracy of their credit information. Instead of properly verifying and correcting the disputed data, they engaged in practices such as sham investigations\u2014meaning investigations that are superficial or intentionally misleading\u2014and neglected to update or correct inaccurate reporting.\n\nThis misconduct is evident in the consumer complaints where TransUnion and other furnishers continued to report inaccurate account statuses, such as defaulted loans despite evidence of settlement or discharge, and failed to document ongoing disputes. For example, Nelnet's refusal to settle accounts despite receipt of negotiable instruments, and TransUnion\u2019s continued reporting of disputed accounts without proper investigation, exemplify these failures.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection under the FCRA are significant. These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting.",

I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter."

            "<1-hop>\n\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally dispute my XXXX XXXX XXXX and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without my authorization, which violates multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt in full, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request ; Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, violating FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections.\n\nBreach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without my authorization'ating my privacy riahts under federai law. Violation of the Higher Education Act ; As a student loan borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections.\n\nBreach of Contract and Negligence ; The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, putting my financial security at risk. And unauthorized disclosure to third parties",
            "<2-hop>\n\nThis is a formal legal demand for immediate investigation and permanent deletion of all student loan accounts reported under the tradeline \" DEPT OF XXXX, '' which is NELNET, XXXX my credit report. These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. \n\nIt has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. \n\nThe unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. \n\nFurthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable. The data being reported by your bureau in relation to the \" DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN '' tradeline is now under legal dispute due to illegality of origin and breach of contract. Continued furnishing or reinsertion of this information without legal justification or lawful verification constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law, making your agency liable under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. \n\nNelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. \n\nAny delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. \n\nYou have been formally notified."

            "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",
            "I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.",
            "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer."

However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers."

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due.

The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",
            "I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated.",

This indicates problems with how payments are processed and recorded.\n\n2. **Failure to Transfer Auto-Pay Information:** Borrowers reported that their automatic payment setups were not transferred properly during the servicing transition, leading to missed payments and negative credit impacts.\n\n3. **Miscalculations of Payment Amounts:** There are reports of gross miscalculations of monthly payments, especially for borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, with Aidvantage admitting to systemic errors that resulted in incorrect payment quotes.\n\n4. **Lack of Proper Notification and Communication:** Several complaints highlight inadequate notification about servicing transfers and changes, which affected auto-pay setups and payment processing.\n\nOverall, these issues point to systemic problems with payment calculations, processing, and communication during the transition to Aidvantage's servicing.",

Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action.

            "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.",
            "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

            "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.",

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.",
            "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

            "text": "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer."

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI initially had XXXX as my student loan provider but decided to consolidate my loans and chose AidVantage as the provider. The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year> with first payment due on XX/XX/year>. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I paid off my student loans in XXXX The Department of education/aidvantage keeps asking me for money. I had contacted a representative at aidvantage letting them know that I have documentation from the bank and they had made an error. Whoever I spoke with said that they would look into it, but aidvantage is still asking me for money and ruining my credit score."

Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4.

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The family education rights and privacy act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality od student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was accessed without my authorization by a third party not affiliated with the issuer of my student loans. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

            "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1.

They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.",

This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception.

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The family education rights and privacy act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality od student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information.Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was accessed without my authorization by a third party not affiliated with the issuer of my student loans. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and the responsibility to safeguard my information.\n\nPursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 is a section of the U.S. Code : Which aims to ensure that consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) like credit bureaus act fairly and equitably towards consumers. This includes protecting consumers ' privacy while balancing the needs of commerce for information.\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report a significant and deeply concerning breach of my personal data related to my student loan records. It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.\n\nThis unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts.

They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.",

This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception.

            "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",
            "Customer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Several things are going on with Nelnet. \n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.",
            "This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem."

In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.",
            "In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved."

            "text": "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Several things are going on with Nelnet. \n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem."

In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.",

During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved."

            "context": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI initially had XXXX as my student loan provider but decided to consolidate my loans and chose AidVantage as the provider. The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year> with first payment due on XX/XX/year>. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I paid off my student loans in XXXX The Department of education/aidvantage keeps asking me for money. I had contacted a representative at aidvantage letting them know that I have documentation from the bank and they had made an error. Whoever I spoke with said that they would look into it, but aidvantage is still asking me for money and ruining my credit score.",

Keep records of all communications.\n\n2. **Check Your Online Account:** Try to access your account again, possibly using a different device or clearing your browser cache, to see if the current forbearance status and end date are reflected there.\n\n3. **Dispute Any Discrepancies:** If your online account shows a different end date than what you were told, or if you receive conflicting information, formally dispute the discrepancy with your servicer and request a written explanation.\n\n4. **Address Communication Issues:** Since you've experienced trouble logging in and long wait times, consider reaching out via certified mail or through your loan servicer\u2019s official contact channels to ensure your requests are documented.\n\n5. **Seek Assistance:** If your servicer is unresponsive or provides inconsistent information, you can contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for further assistance.\n\nRegarding the long wait and disconnection problems:\n\n- **Try calling during off-peak hours** to reduce wait times.\n- **Use online chat or email options** if available.\n- **File a complaint** with the CFPB if you experience persistent issues with customer service or transparency.\n\nRemember, without written proof, your best course is to obtain official documentation directly from your loan servicer and keep detailed records of all interactions.",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI got a subsidized loan. After having issues with the university I was attending I took a semester off to transfer to a new school. In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.\nIn a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved."

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.",
            "answer": "The FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) is relevant because the continued collection efforts and deceptive practices by the loan servicer, including the transfer of accounts and failure to respond to consumer complaints, violate protections under the FDCPA. The misconduct by Nelnet, such as ignoring certified mail complaints and engaging in deceptive acts, also breaches laws like the FDCPA, which aims to prevent unfair and abusive debt collection practices, especially when the student loans are legally void and the servicer's actions are questionable."

            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

            "context": "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nCustomer Issue: Improper use of your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Several things are going on with Nelnet. \n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.\nThis account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX. We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. \n\nDespite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. \n\nXXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.",

My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

            "context": "Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \n\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nI am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \n\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\n\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.\nI got a subsidized loan. After having issues with the university I was attending I took a semester off to transfer to a new school. In that time they put me on forbearance twice without reaching out to me for it and sent vague emails about needing to look at my account. In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.\nIn a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved.",

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

            "context": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nSubject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a former complaint against AidVantage, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1.

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately.

            "text": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nSubject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting & Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a former complaint against AidVantage, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3.

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \n\nViolations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur."

            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \n\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied.

          "response": "The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that governs the behavior of third-party debt collectors and aims to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. In the context of the complaints involving Nelnet and illegal student loan reporting, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations when debt collectors or loan servicers engage in misconduct, such as misrepresenting account status, continuing collection efforts after debts are invalid or settled, or engaging in deceptive practices.\n\nFrom the provided complaints, Nelnet's actions\u2014such as refusing to update account statuses after settlement, continuing to report delinquent accounts despite evidence of payment or settlement, and engaging in collection activities on legally void or unverified debts\u2014may violate provisions of the FDCPA. These violations include misrepresenting the amount or status of a debt, failing to cease collection efforts after the debt is settled or invalid, and using deceptive practices to collect or report debts.\n\nAdditionally, the complaints highlight violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), such as inaccurate credit reporting and failure to correct erroneous information, which are also protected under consumer rights laws.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA relates to these violations by providing consumers with protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices by loan servicers like Nelnet. When Nelnet continues collection activities or reports inaccurate information despite evidence of settlement or invalidity, it may be engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA, thereby violating consumer rights.",

            "context": "Customer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \n\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \n\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \n\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \n\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \n\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \n\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

            "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent.

          ],
          "response": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system."

            "answer": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

In the context of the complaints involving Nelnet and illegal student loan reporting, the FDCPA relates to consumer rights violations when debt collectors or loan servicers engage in misconduct, such as misrepresenting account status, continuing collection efforts after debts are invalid or settled, or engaging in deceptive practices.\n\nFrom the provided complaints, Nelnet's actions\u2014such as refusing to update account statuses after settlement, continuing to report delinquent accounts despite evidence of payment or settlement, and engaging in collection activities on legally void or unverified debts\u2014may violate provisions of the FDCPA. These violations include misrepresenting the amount or status of a debt, failing to cease collection efforts after the debt is settled or invalid, and using deceptive practices to collect or report debts.\n\nAdditionally, the complaints highlight violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), such as inaccurate credit reporting and failure to correct erroneous information, which are also protected under consumer rights laws.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA relates to these violations by providing consumers with protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices by loan servicers like Nelnet. When Nelnet continues collection activities or reports inaccurate information despite evidence of settlement or invalidity, it may be engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA, thereby violating consumer rights.",

Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint.

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system."

For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system."

Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \n\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \n\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or investigation your office can provide regarding potential restitution or remediation. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",

These violations include misrepresenting the amount or status of a debt, failing to cease collection efforts after the debt is settled or invalid, and using deceptive practices to collect or report debts.\n\nAdditionally, the complaints highlight violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), such as inaccurate credit reporting and failure to correct erroneous information, which are also protected under consumer rights laws.\n\nIn summary, the FDCPA relates to these violations by providing consumers with protections against unfair, deceptive, or abusive collection practices by loan servicers like Nelnet. When Nelnet continues collection activities or reports inaccurate information despite evidence of settlement or invalidity, it may be engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA, thereby violating consumer rights.",

I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit.

Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability.

For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

            "text": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Aidvantage did not do its due diligence to make sure they had my accurate info before reaching out about the status of my loans going into repayment. I had no idea I was supposed to start paying again on the loans until I received a credit alert on my report, to which I immediately called them on XX/XX/year> and made my account current ( had I known they were in repayment by phone/email/mail, I would have immediately enrolled in auto pay ). Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days. There was no attempt to reach out or report on 30+ day delinquencies."

          "reference": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

            "answer": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

            "context": "Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.\nI am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\n\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again.\nCustomer Issue: Incorrect information on your report\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Aidvantage did not do its due diligence to make sure they had my accurate info before reaching out about the status of my loans going into repayment. I had no idea I was supposed to start paying again on the loans until I received a credit alert on my report, to which I immediately called them on XX/XX/year> and made my account current ( had I known they were in repayment by phone/email/mail, I would have immediately enrolled in auto pay ). Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days. There was no attempt to reach out or report on 30+ day delinquencies.",

For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

          "reference": "The context indicates that following the Department of Education's abolishment, continued reporting and collection of student loans by entities such as Nelnet are legally questionable. The first segment highlights that credit bureaus are still reporting student loans that are now unverified and potentially void due to the dissolution of the Department of Education, constituting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts."

          "response": "Based on the provided complaints, the abolishment of the U.S. Department of Education appears to impact the legality of ongoing student loan reporting and collection practices. Consumer advocates and complainants argue that once the Department of Education was abolished, the student loans that were previously managed or overseen by it became legally void or unverified. \n\nThe impact includes:\n- Continued reporting of student loans to credit bureaus that are now considered unverified and legally questionable.\n- Ongoing collection efforts by entities like Nelnet despite the loans' legal status being in question following the abolishment.\n- Failure by loan servicers to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations after the Department's dissolution.\n\nLegal violations involved, according to consumer rights advocates, include:\n- Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681), particularly regarding the reporting of unverified or questionable debts.\n- Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692), especially related to unfair and deceptive collection practices and the failure to verify the legitimacy of the debts.\n\nIn summary, the abolishment of the Department of Education has led to claims that continued collection and reporting practices are illegal and violate consumer rights, as the debts are now considered legally void or unverified.",

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \n\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year>2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \n\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \n\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \n\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\n\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\n\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\n\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\n\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX",

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late.

            "I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling the disputed accounts. Specifically, these entities failed to fulfill their legal obligations under the FCRA to conduct reasonable and thorough reinvestigations when consumers disputed the accuracy of their credit information. Instead of properly verifying and correcting the disputed data, they engaged in practices such as sham investigations\u2014meaning investigations that are superficial or intentionally misleading\u2014and neglected to update or correct inaccurate reporting.\n\nThis misconduct is evident in the consumer complaints where TransUnion and other furnishers continued to report inaccurate account statuses, such as defaulted loans despite evidence of settlement or discharge, and failed to document ongoing disputes. For example, Nelnet's refusal to settle accounts despite receipt of negotiable instruments, and TransUnion\u2019s continued reporting of disputed accounts without proper investigation, exemplify these failures.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection under the FCRA are significant. These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting."

The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid. Consumer rights advocates argue that these actions constitute illegal credit reporting, breach of privacy statutes, and violations of federal laws, demanding immediate investigation, deletion of accounts, and cessation of collection efforts.",

            "context": "These cases illustrate the importance of proper processing and communication by Aidvantage in protecting borrower rights in several ways:\n\n1. **Accurate and Timely Notifications:** Several complaints highlight that borrowers were not properly informed about important changes, such as loan transfers, servicing updates, or repayment statuses. For example, one borrower was unaware of the transfer to Aidvantage and received no prior notification, leading to missed auto-pay setups and negative credit impacts. Proper communication ensures borrowers are aware of their loan status and can take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Correct Processing of Payments and Account Information:** Issues like the failure to transfer auto-pay information or incorrect reporting of account status demonstrate that accurate processing is crucial. When Aidvantage did not carry over auto-pay setups or reported delinquencies without proper basis, it resulted in financial and credit harm to borrowers. Proper processing safeguards borrowers from unintended defaults or credit damage.\n\n3. **Adherence to Federal Regulations and Guidance:** The complaint about unauthorized interest accrual during the SAVE plan\u2019s administrative forbearance period shows that failure to follow federal directives can lead to unjustified financial burdens on borrowers. Proper processing aligned with regulations protects borrowers from unfair charges.\n\n4. **Effective Communication to Prevent Misunderstandings:** The systemic issues in follow-up and false reporting to authorities, as well as the lack of response to borrower inquiries, demonstrate that clear and consistent communication is vital. It helps build trust, ensures borrowers understand their rights and obligations, and prevents misinformation.\n\nOverall, these cases underscore that diligent, transparent, and compliant processing and communication by Aidvantage are essential to uphold borrower rights, prevent financial harm, and maintain trust in the student loan servicing system.",

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well.

This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

            "I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.",
            "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level."

          "response": "The violation of the FCRA by XXXX and XXXX, including sham investigations and failure to conduct proper reinvestigations, directly relates to the misconduct and errors made by XXXX and Nelnet in handling the disputed accounts. Specifically, these entities failed to fulfill their legal obligations under the FCRA to conduct reasonable and thorough reinvestigations when consumers disputed the accuracy of their credit information. Instead of properly verifying and correcting the disputed data, they engaged in practices such as sham investigations\u2014meaning investigations that are superficial or intentionally misleading\u2014and neglected to update or correct inaccurate reporting.\n\nThis misconduct is evident in the consumer complaints where TransUnion and other furnishers continued to report inaccurate account statuses, such as defaulted loans despite evidence of settlement or discharge, and failed to document ongoing disputes. For example, Nelnet's refusal to settle accounts despite receipt of negotiable instruments, and TransUnion\u2019s continued reporting of disputed accounts without proper investigation, exemplify these failures.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection under the FCRA are significant. These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting.",

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\nI am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items.\n\nRecent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA.\n\nAs per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX  and XXXX  is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.\n\nConduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : EDFinancial Services through 15 accounts totaling {$35000.00}.\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

            "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter.

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter."

In the fall of XXXX  I tried logging in to prove I was a student after getting an email regarding past due payments. They couldnt locate my account on the website I tried a few more times but said my information couldnt be located even though I was receiving emails. I tried calling the number provided but I dont remember the conversation just that it didnt help I was finally able to access my account less than 30 days ago and made a payment on the past due amount. I reached out as they ended up putting XXXX reports of missed payments on my credit history. They confirmed the issue but said I had not called. If they have access to my email and phone number information then I shouldve never had to have spent months trying to get access to my account. I can pull my call history and prove I tried calling as well. When I reached out to see if they could correct the report on my history they said they would not unless I could prove I was a student at the time of the report or was military but the error occurred regardless of either of those statuses. I can also provide my transcript for the fall but I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and will not have classes till the summer and do not think they reported me in the XXXX semester I am not taking classes as a coincidence after putting me on unauthorized forbearance while I was taking classes.",

Such breaches can lead to unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or fraud, and undermine your rights to privacy and data security.\n\nTherefore, FERPA violations relate to these issues by indicating that your rights to confidentiality and proper data handling were not upheld, resulting in the exposure and misuse of your personal and loan-related information.",
          "reference": "The violation of FERPA is directly related to the improper use of your student loan report because your student records were disclosed without your consent, which breaches FERPA's strict confidentiality protections. This violation is part of the broader context where your personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without authorization, violating federal laws designed to protect student records and privacy rights. The breach of FERPA, along with other laws like the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Higher Education Act, underscores the legal violations involved in the mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of your data, which supports your claim for legal dispute and resolution."

This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \n\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \n\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \n\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \n\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition.",

My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.\n\nDepartment of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould\n\nbe permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.\n\nGiven the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.\n\nImmediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.\n\nWritten confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.\n\nConsideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.\n\nI have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of the steps your office will take in response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet.

However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations.

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action.

            "text": "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter. You may contact me via phone or email to discuss this dispute further. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised WITHOUT my authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, ( FERPA ), protects the confidentiality of Student Records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and resulting compromise to my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised without authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach clearly violates FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise on my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter."

            "context": "XX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and Metro 2 Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \n2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \n3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \n4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "context": "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter. You may contact me via phone or email to discuss this dispute further. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\nCustomer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised WITHOUT my authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, ( FERPA ), protects the confidentiality of Student Records. This breach is a clear violation of FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and resulting compromise to my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: My personal and financial information was compromised without authorization. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) protects the confidentiality of student records. This breach clearly violates FERPA and your responsibility to safeguard my information. Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise on my personal and financial information, I request that you immediately discharge my student loan debt.\nCustomer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

            "To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute my student loan account due to a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and a breach of my personal data. I recently became aware of unauthorized disclosures of my personally identifiable information ( PII ), which directly impact my loan account and my financial security. \n\nUnder FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), my educational records and personal data should have been protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter. You may contact me via phone or email to discuss this dispute further. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX",

            "Customer Issue: Struggling to repay your loan\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning serious violations related to the management and security of my student loan data. These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter."

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \n\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \n\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\n\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer ( DEPTEDNELNET ) has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \n\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.",

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. \n\nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \n2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \n3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \n4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter.

I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\n\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\n\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem.",

Instead of properly verifying and correcting the disputed data, they engaged in practices such as sham investigations\u2014meaning investigations that are superficial or intentionally misleading\u2014and neglected to update or correct inaccurate reporting.\n\nThis misconduct is evident in the consumer complaints where TransUnion and other furnishers continued to report inaccurate account statuses, such as defaulted loans despite evidence of settlement or discharge, and failed to document ongoing disputes. For example, Nelnet's refusal to settle accounts despite receipt of negotiable instruments, and TransUnion\u2019s continued reporting of disputed accounts without proper investigation, exemplify these failures.\n\nThe implications for consumer protection under the FCRA are significant. These violations undermine consumers' rights to accurate credit reporting and fair dispute resolution. When furnishers and credit reporting agencies conduct sham investigations or ignore proper procedures, consumers are left with inaccurate information that can harm their credit scores, financial standing, and ability to access credit or benefits. Such misconduct also erodes trust in the credit reporting system and highlights the need for strict enforcement of the FCRA to ensure that entities conduct genuine, comprehensive investigations and uphold accuracy and transparency in credit reporting.",

Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan.

However, I have reason to believe that my information was improperly handled, which may have led to unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, or mismanagement of my loan account. \n\nAdditionally, I have been notified of a potential data breach involving my student loan information, which has put my financial identity at risk. This breach is a direct violation of my rights and calls into question the legitimacy and security of my student loan records. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I request the following actions : A complete investigation into how my personal and loan-related information was compromised.\n\nVerification and correction of any inaccuracies in my student loan records resulting from this breach.\n\nA hold or suspension on any loan payments until this matter is fully resolved. \n\nA written statement outlining the actions taken to protect my data and prevent further violations. \n\nPlease provide me with a response within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required under applicable federal regulations. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and pursue further legal action. \n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter.

            "context": "I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \n\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \n\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \n\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \n\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \n\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \n\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \n\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \n\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \n\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \n\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \n\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\n\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \n\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\n\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \n\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\n\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\n\n3.

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \nXXXX. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \nXXXX. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \nXXXX. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while XXXX XXXX and XXXX applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "context": "XX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. \nBackground : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. \nIn addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in \" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. \nTo date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. \n\nLegal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. \nXXXX. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. \nXXXX. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. \nXXXX. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. \n\nImmediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX guidelines. \n\nCease reporting any default status or negative information while XXXX XXXX and XXXX applications remain pending. \n\nAn official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. \n\nReferral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. \n\nTransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. \n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX",

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \n\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \n\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \n\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. \n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). \nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX",

These violations have caused harm to my financial well-being, breached my federally protected privacy rights, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken to investigate and rectify the matter, including full discharge of my student loan debt and removal of related accounts from my credit reports. \n\n1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.\n\n2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. \n\n3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.\n\n4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.\n\nThese breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.\n\nRequested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.\n\n2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.\n\n3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.\n\n4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.\n\nI respectfully request a prompt review of this complaint and look forward to your response and action. Please contact me via email or phone to confirm receipt and discuss next steps.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this serious matter.",

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",

The second segment further explains that unauthorized access to borrower data and continued reporting of accounts under the 'DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN' tradeline violate federal privacy laws like the Privacy Act of 1974, FERPA, and the Higher Education Act. It also states that the contractual obligations of the Department of Education and its agents have been breached, rendering the associated debt and reporting invalid.

            "context": "Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: Nelnet received my negotiable Bill of Exchange ( BOE ) on XX/XX/year>, clearly issued with the intent to lawfully settle and close my federal student loan account. This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. \n\nNelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. \n\nMoreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. \n\nASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. \n\nASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. \n\nThese failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late. Their refusal to update their books and cease harmful reporting practices constitutes accounting fraud and administrative negligence at the highest level.",
